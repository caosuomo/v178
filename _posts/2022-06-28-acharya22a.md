title: Robust Estimation for Random Graphs
abstract: We study the problem of robustly estimating the parameter $p$ of an Erdős-Rényi
  random graph on $n$ nodes, where a $\gamma$ fraction of nodes may be adversarially
  corrupted. After showing the deficiencies of canonical estimators, we design a computationally-efficient
  spectral algorithm which estimates $p$ up to accuracy $\tilde O(\sqrt{p(1-p)}/n
  + \gamma\sqrt{p(1-p)} /\sqrt{n}+ \gamma/n)$ for $\gamma < 1/60$. Furthermore, we
  give an inefficient algorithm with similar accuracy for all $\gamma<1/2$, the information-theoretic
  limit. Finally, we prove a nearly-matching statistical lower bound, showing that
  the error of our algorithms is optimal up to logarithmic factors.
