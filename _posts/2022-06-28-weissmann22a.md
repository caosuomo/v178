title: Multilevel Optimization for Inverse Problems
abstract: Inverse problems occur in a variety of parameter identification tasks in
  engineering. Such problems are challenging in practice, as they require repeated
  evaluation of computationally expensive forward models. We introduce a unifying
  framework of multilevel optimization that can be applied to a wide range of optimization-based
  solvers. Our framework provably reduces the computational cost associated with evaluating
  the expensive forward maps stemming from various physical models. To demonstrate
  the versatility of our analysis, we discuss its implications for various methodologies
  including multilevel (accelerated, stochastic) gradient descent, a multilevel ensemble
  Kalman inversion and a multilevel Langevin sampler. We also provide numerical experiments
  to verify our theoretical findings.
