title: Improved analysis for a proximal algorithm for sampling
abstract: 'We study the proximal sampler of Lee, Shen, and Tian (2021) and obtain
  new convergence guarantees under weaker assumptions than strong log-concavity: namely,
  our results hold for (1) weakly log-concave targets, and (2) targets satisfying
  isoperimetric assumptions which allow for non-log-concavity. We demonstrate our
  results by obtaining new state-of-the-art sampling guarantees for several classes
  of target distributions. We also strengthen the connection between the proximal
  sampler and the proximal method in optimization by interpreting the former as an
  entropically regularized Wasserstein gradient flow and the latter as the limit of
  one.'
