title: Self-Consistency of the Fokker Planck Equation
abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is the partial differential equation that
  governs the density evolution of the Ito process and is of great importance to the
  literature of statistical physics and machine learning. The FPE can be regarded
  as a continuity equation where the change of the density is completely determined
  by a time varying velocity field. Importantly, this velocity field also depends
  on the current density function. As a result, the ground-truth velocity field can
  be shown to be the solution of a fixed-point equation, a property that we call self-consistency.
  In this paper, we exploit this concept to design a potential function of the hypothesis
  velocity fields, and prove that, if such a function diminishes to zero during the
  training procedure, the trajectory of the densities generated by the hypothesis
  velocity fields converges to the solution of the FPE in the Wasserstein-2 sense.
  The proposed potential function is amenable to neural-network based parameterization
  as the stochastic gradient with respect to the parameter can be efficiently computed.
  Once a parameterized model, such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equation is trained,
  we can generate the entire trajectory to the FPE.
