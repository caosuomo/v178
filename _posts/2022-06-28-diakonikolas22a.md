title: Optimal SQ Lower Bounds for Robustly Learning Discrete Product Distributions
  and Ising Models
abstract: We establish optimal Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds for robustly learning
  certain families of discrete high-dimensional distributions. In particular, we show
  that no efficient SQ algorithm with access to an $\eps$-corrupted binary product
  distribution can learn its mean within $\ell_2$-error $o(\eps \sqrt{\log(1/\eps)})$.  Similarly,
  we show that no efficient SQ algorithm with access to an $\eps$-corrupted ferromagnetic
  high-temperature Ising model can learn the model  to total variation distance $o(\eps
  \log(1/\eps))$. Our SQ lower bounds match the error guarantees of known algorithms
  for these problems, providing evidence that current upper bounds for these tasks
  are best possible. At the technical level, we develop a generic SQ lower bound for
  discrete high-dimensional distributions starting from low-dimensional moment matching
  constructions that we believe will find other applications. Additionally, we introduce
  new ideas to analyze these moment-matching constructions for discrete univariate
  distributions.
