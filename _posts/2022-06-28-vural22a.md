title: 'Mirror Descent Strikes Again: Optimal Stochastic Convex Optimization under
  Infinite Noise Variance'
abstract: We study stochastic convex optimization under infinite noise variance. Specifically,
  when the stochastic gradient is unbiased and has uniformly bounded $(1+\kappa)$-th
  moment, for some $\kappa \in (0,1]$, we quantify the convergence rate of the Stochastic
  Mirror Descent algorithm with a particular class of uniformly convex mirror maps,
  in terms of the number of iterations, dimensionality and related geometric parameters
  of the optimization problem. Interestingly this algorithm does not require any explicit
  gradient clipping or normalization, which have been extensively used in several
  recent empirical and theoretical works. We complement our convergence results with
  information-theoretic lower bounds showing that no other algorithm using only stochastic
  first-order oracles can achieve improved rates. Our results have several interesting
  consequences for devising online/streaming stochastic approximation algorithms for
  problems arising in robust statistics and machine learning.
