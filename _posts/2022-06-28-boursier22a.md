title: Trace norm regularization for multi-task learning with scarce data
abstract: Multi-task learning leverages structural similarities between multiple tasks
  to learn despite very few samples. Motivated by the recent success of neural networks
  applied to data-scarce tasks, we consider a linear low-dimensional shared representation
  model. Despite an extensive literature, existing theoretical results either guarantee
  weak estimation rates or require a large number of samples per task. This work provides
  the first estimation error bound for the trace norm regularized estimator when the
  number of samples per task is small. The advantages of trace norm regularization
  for learning data-scarce tasks extend to meta-learning and are confirmed empirically
  on synthetic datasets.
