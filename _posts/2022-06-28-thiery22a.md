title: Two-Sided Weak Submodularity for Matroid Constrained Optimization and Regression
abstract: 'We study the following problem: Given a variable of interest, we would
  like to find a best linear predictor for it by choosing a subset of k relevant variables
  obeying a matroid constraint. This problem is a natural generalization of subset
  selection problems where it is necessary to spread observations amongst multiple
  different classes. We derive new, strengthened guarantees for this problem by improving
  the analysis of the residual random greedy algorithm and by developing a novel distorted
  local-search algorithm. To quantify our approximation guarantees, we refine the
  definition of weak submodularity by  Das and Kempe (2011) and introduce the notion
  of an upper submodularity ratio, which we connect to the minimum k-sparse eigenvalue
  of the covariance matrix. More generally, we look at the problem of maximizing a
  set function f with lower and upper submodularity ratio $\gamma$ and $\beta$ under
  a matroid constraint. For this problem, our algorithms have asymptotic approximation
  guarantee 1/2 and (1 - 1/e) as the function is closer to being submodular. As a
  second application, we show that the Bayesian A-optimal design objective falls into
  our framework, leading to new guarantees for this problem as well.'
