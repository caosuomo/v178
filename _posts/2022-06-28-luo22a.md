title: Adaptive Bandit Convex Optimization with Heterogeneous Curvature
abstract: We consider the problem of adversarial bandit convex optimization, that
  is, online learning over a sequence of arbitrary convex loss functions with only
  one function evaluation for each of them. While all previous works assume known
  and homogeneous curvature on these loss functions, we study a heterogeneous setting
  where each function has its own curvature that is only revealed after the learner
  makes a decision. We develop an efficient algorithm that is able to adapt to the
  curvature on the fly. Specifically, our algorithm not only recovers or \emph{even
  improves} existing results for several homogeneous settings, but also leads to surprising
  results for some heterogeneous settings â€” for example, while  Hazan and Levy (2014)
  showed that $\tilde{O}(d^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable for a sequence
  of $T$ smooth and strongly convex $d$-dimensional functions, our algorithm reveals
  that the same is achievable even if $T^{\frac{3}{4}}$ of them are not strongly convex,
  and sometimes even if a constant fraction of them are not strongly convex. Our approach
  is inspired by the framework of Bartlett et al. (2007) who studied a similar heterogeneous
  setting but with stronger gradient feedback. Extending their framework to the bandit
  feedback setting requires novel ideas such as lifting the feasible domain and using
  a logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier regularizer.
