title: Improved Parallel Algorithm for Minimum Cost Submodular Cover Problem
abstract: 'In the minimum cost submodular cover problem (MinSMC), we are given a monotone
  nondecreasing submodular function $f\colon 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+$, a linear
  cost function $c: V\rightarrow \mathbb R^{+}$, and an integer $k\leq f(V)$, the
  goal is to find a subset $A\subseteq V$ with the minimum cost such that $f(A)\geq
  k$. The MinSMC  can be found at the heart of many machine learning and data mining
  applications. In this paper, we design a parallel algorithm for the MinSMC  that
  takes at most $O(\frac{\log (km)\log k(\log m+\log\log (mk))}{\varepsilon^4})$ adaptive
  rounds, and it achieves an approximation ratio of $\frac{H(\min\{\Delta,k\})}{1-5\varepsilon}$
  with probability at least  $1-3\varepsilon$, where $\Delta=\max_{v\in V}f(v)$, $H(\cdot)$
  is the Harmonic number, $m=|V|$, and $\varepsilon$ is a constant in $(0,\frac{1}{5})$.'
