title: New Projection-free Algorithms for Online Convex Optimization with Adaptive
  Regret Guarantees
abstract: We present new efficient \emph{projection-free} algorithms for online convex
  optimization (OCO), where by projection-free we refer to algorithms that avoid computing
  orthogonal projections onto the feasible set,  and instead relay on different and
  potentially much more efficient oracles. While most state-of-the-art projection-free
  algorithms are based on the \emph{follow-the-leader} framework, our algorithms are
  fundamentally different and are based on the \emph{online gradient descent} algorithm
  with a novel and efficient approach to computing so-called \emph{infeasible projections}.  As
  a consequence, we obtain the first projection-free algorithms which naturally yield
  \emph{adaptive regret} guarantees, i.e., regret bounds that hold w.r.t. any sub-interval
  of the sequence.  Concretely, when assuming the availability of a linear optimization
  oracle (LOO) for the feasible set, on a sequence of length $T$, our algorithms guarantee
  $O(T^{3/4})$ adaptive regret and  $O(T^{3/4})$ adaptive expected regret, for the
  full-information and bandit settings, respectively, using only $O(T)$ calls to the
  LOO. These bounds match the current state-of-the-art regret bounds for LOO-based
  projection-free OCO, which are \emph{not adaptive}.  We also consider a new natural
  setting in which the feasible set is accessible through a separation oracle.    We
  present algorithms which, using overall $O(T)$ calls to the separation oracle, guarantee  $O(\sqrt{T})$
  adaptive regret and $O(T^{3/4})$ adaptive expected regret for the full-information
  and bandit settings, respectively.
