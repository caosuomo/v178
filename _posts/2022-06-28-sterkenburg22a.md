title: On characterizations of learnability with computable learners
abstract: We study computable PAC (CPAC) learning as introduced by Agarwal et al.
  (2020). First, we consider the main open question of finding characterizations of
  proper and improper CPAC learning. We give a characterization of a closely related
  notion of *strong* CPAC learning, and we provide a negative answer to the COLT open
  problem posed by Agarwal et al. (2021) whether all decidably representable PAC learnable
  classes are improperly CPAC learnable. Second, we consider undecidability of (computable)
  PAC learnability. We give a simple general argument to exhibit such undecidability,
  and we initiate a study of the arithmetical complexity of learnability. We briefly
  discuss the relation to the undecidability result of Ben-David et al. (2019), that
  motivated the work of Agarwal et al.
