title: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Realizability and Single-policy Concentrability
abstract: Sample-efficiency guarantees for offline reinforcement learning (RL) often
  rely on strong assumptions on both the function classes (e.g., Bellman-completeness)
  and the data coverage (e.g., all-policy concentrability). Despite the recent efforts
  on relaxing these assumptions, existing works are only able to relax one of the
  two factors, leaving the strong assumption on the other factor intact. As an important
  open problem, can we achieve sample-efficient offline RL with weak assumptions on
  both factors?  In this paper we answer the question in the positive. We analyze
  a simple algorithm based on the primal-dual formulation of MDPs, where the dual
  variables (discounted occupancy) are modeled using a density-ratio function against
  offline data. With proper regularization, the algorithm enjoys polynomial sample
  complexity, under only realizability and single-policy concentrability. We also
  provide alternative analyses based on different assumptions to shed light on the
  nature of primal-dual algorithms for offline RL.
