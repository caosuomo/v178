title: 'Non-Linear Reinforcement Learning in Large Action Spaces: Structural Conditions
  and Sample-efficiency of Posterior Sampling'
abstract: Provably sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) with rich observations
  and function approximation has witnessed tremendous recent progress, particularly
  when the underlying function approximators are linear. In this linear regime, computationally
  and statistically efficient methods exist where the potentially infinite state and
  action spaces can be captured through a known feature embedding, with the sample
  complexity scaling with the (intrinsic) dimension of these features. When the action
  space is finite, significantly more sophisticated results allow non-linear function
  approximation under appropriate structural constraints on the underlying RL problem,
  permitting for instance, the learning of good features instead of assuming access
  to them. In this work, we present the first result for non-linear function approximation
  which holds for general action spaces under a linear embeddability condition, which
  generalizes all linear and finite action settings. We design a novel optimistic
  posterior sampling strategy, TS$^3$ for such problems. We further show worst case
  sample complexity guarantees that scale with a rank parameter of the RL problem,
  the linear embedding dimension introduced here and standard measures of function
  class complexity.
