title: Private Matrix Approximation and Geometry of Unitary Orbits
abstract: 'Consider the following optimization problem: Given $n \times n$  matrices
  $A$ and $\Lambda$,  maximize $⟨A, U\Lambda U^*⟩$ where $U$ varies over the unitary
  group $\mathrm{U}(n)$. This problem seeks to approximate $A$ by a matrix whose spectrum
  is the same as $\Lambda$ and, by setting $\Lambda$ to be appropriate diagonal matrices,
  one can recover matrix approximation problems such as PCA and rank-$k$ approximation.
  We study the problem of designing differentially private algorithms for this optimization
  problem in settings where the matrix $A$ is constructed using users’ private data.
  We give efficient and  private algorithms that come with upper and lower bounds
  on the approximation error. Our results unify and improve upon several prior works
  on  private matrix approximation problems. They rely on extensions of  packing/covering
  number bounds for Grassmannians to unitary orbits which should be of independent
  interest.'
