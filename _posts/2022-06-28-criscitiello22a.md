title: Negative curvature obstructs acceleration for strongly geodesically convex
  optimization, even with exact first-order oracles
abstract: 'Hamilton and Moitra (2021) showed that, in certain regimes, it is not possible
  to accelerate Riemannian gradient descent in the hyperbolic plane if we restrict
  ourselves to algorithms which make queries in a (large) bounded domain and which
  receive gradients and function values corrupted by a (small) amount of noise.  We
  show that acceleration remains unachievable for any deterministic algorithm which
  receives exact gradient and function-value information (unbounded queries, no noise).  Our
  results hold for a large class of Hadamard manifolds including hyperbolic spaces
  and the symmetric space $\mathrm{SL}(n) / \mathrm{SO}(n)$ of positive definite $n
  \times n$ matrices of determinant one.  This cements a surprising gap between the
  complexity of convex optimization and geodesically convex optimization: for hyperbolic
  spaces, Riemannian gradient descent is optimal on the class of smooth and strongly
  geodesically convex functions (in the regime where the condition number scales with
  the radius of the optimization domain).  The key idea for proving the lower bound
  consists of perturbing squared distance functions with sums of bump functions chosen
  by a resisting oracle.'
