title: On The Memory Complexity of Uniformity Testing
abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of uniformity testing with limited
  memory. We observe a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables
  drawn from a distribution $p$ over $[n]$, which is either uniform or is $\eps$-far
  from uniform under the total variation distance, and our goal is to determine the
  correct hypothesis. At each time point we are allowed to update the state of a finite-memory
  machine with $S$ states, where each state of the machine is assigned one of the
  hypotheses, and we are interested in obtaining an asymptotic probability of error
  at most $0<\delta<1/2$ uniformly under both hypotheses.  The main contribution of
  this paper is deriving upper and lower bounds on the number of states $S$ needed
  in order to achieve a constant error probability $\delta$, as a function of $n$
  and $\eps$, where our upper bound is $O(\frac{n\log n}{\eps})$ and our lower bound
  is $\Omega (n+\frac{1}{\eps})$. Prior works in the field have almost exclusively
  used  collision counting for upper bounds, and the Paninski mixture for lower bounds.
  Somewhat surprisingly, in the limited memory with unlimited samples setup, the optimal
  solution does not involve counting collisions, and the Paninski prior is not hard,
  thus different proof techniques are needed in order to attain our bounds.
