title: Lattice-Based Methods Surpass Sum-of-Squares in Clustering
abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning which gives
  rise to a rich class of computationally-challenging inference tasks. In this work,
  we focus on the canonical task of clustering d-dimensional Gaussian mixtures with
  unknown (and possibly degenerate) covariance. Recent works (Ghosh et al. ’20; Mao,
  Wein ’21; Davis, Diaz, Wang ’21) have established lower bounds against the class
  of low-degree polynomial methods and the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy for recovering
  certain hidden structures planted in Gaussian clustering instances. Prior work on
  many similar inference tasks portends that such lower bounds strongly suggest the
  presence of an inherent statistical-to-computational gap for clustering, that is,
  a parameter regime where the clustering task is statistically possible but no polynomial-time
  algorithm succeeds. One special case of the clustering task we consider is equivalent
  to the problem of finding a planted hypercube vector in an otherwise random subspace.
  We show that, perhaps surprisingly, this particular clustering model does not exhibit
  a statistical-to-computational gap, even though the aforementioned low-degree and
  SoS lower bounds continue to apply in this case. To achieve this, we give a polynomial-time
  algorithm based on the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovasz lattice basis reduction method which
  achieves the statistically-optimal sample complexity of d+1 samples. This result
  extends the class of problems whose conjectured statistical-to-computational gaps
  can be "closed" by "brittle" polynomial-time algorithms, highlighting the crucial
  but subtle role of noise in the onset of statistical-to-computational gaps.
