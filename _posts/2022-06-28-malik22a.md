title: Complete Policy Regret Bounds for Tallying Bandits
abstract: Policy regret is a well established notion of measuring the performance
  of an online learning algorithm against an adaptive adversary. We study restrictions
  on the adversary that enable efficient minimization of the \emph{complete policy
  regret}, which is the strongest possible version of policy regret. We identify a
  gap in the current theoretical understanding of what sorts of restrictions permit
  tractability in this challenging setting. To resolve this gap, we consider a generalization
  of the stochastic multi armed bandit, which we call the \emph{tallying bandit}.
  This is an online learning setting with an $m$-memory bounded adversary, where the
  average loss for playing an action is an unknown function of the number (or tally)
  of times that the action was played in the last $m$ timesteps. For tallying bandit
  problems with $\numact$ actions and time horizon $T$, we provide an algorithm that
  w.h.p achieves a complete policy regret guarantee of $\bigo ( m \numact \sqrt{T}
  )$, where the $\bigo$ notation hides only logarithmic factors. We additionally prove
  an $\bigomega(\sqrt{ m \numact T})$ lower bound on the expected complete policy
  regret of any tallying bandit algorithm, demonstrating the near optimality of our
  method.
