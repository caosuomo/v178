title: Better Private Algorithms for Correlation Clustering
abstract: In machine learning, correlation clustering is an important problem whose
  goal is to partition the individuals into groups that correlate with their pairwise
  similarities as much as possible. In this work, we revisit the correlation clustering
  under the differential privacy constraints. Particularly, we improve previous results
  and achieve an $\Tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ additive error compared to the optimal cost
  in expectation on general graphs.  As for unweighted complete graphs, we improve
  the results further and propose a more involved algorithm which achieves $\Tilde{O}(n
  \sqrt{\Delta^*})$ additive error, where $\Delta^*$ is the maximum degrees of positive
  edges among all nodes.
