title: Strong Gaussian Approximation for the Sum of Random Vectors
abstract: This paper derives a new strong Gaussian approximation bound for the sum
  of independent random vectors. The approach relies on the optimal transport theory
  and yields explicit dependence on the dimension size p and the sample size n. This
  dependence establishes a new fundamental limit for all practical applications of
  statistical learning theory. Particularly, based on this bound, we prove approximation
  in distribution for the maximum norm in a high-dimensional setting (p > n).
