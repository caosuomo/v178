title: 'Random Graph Matching in Geometric Models: the Case of Complete Graphs'
abstract: This paper studies the problem of matching two complete graphs with edge
  weights correlated through latent geometries, extending a recent line of research
  on random graph matching with independent edge weights to geometric models.  Specifically,
  given a random permutation $\pi^*$ on $[n]$ and $n$ iid pairs of correlated Gaussian
  vectors $\{X_{\pi^*(i)}, Y_i\}$ in $\reals^d$ with noise parameter $\sigma$, the
  edge weights are given by $A_{ij}=\kappa(X_i,X_j)$ and $B_{ij}=\kappa(Y_i,Y_j)$
  for some link function $\kappa$. The goal is to recover the hidden vertex correspondence
  $\pi^*$ based on the observation of $A$ and $B$. We focus on the dot-product model
  with $\kappa(x,y)=⟨x, y ⟩$ and Euclidean distance model with $\kappa(x,y)=\|x-y\|^2$,
  in the low-dimensional regime of $d=o(\log n)$ wherein the underlying geometric
  structures are most evident. We derive an approximate maximum likelihood estimator,
  which provably achieves, with high probability, perfect recovery of $\pi^*$  when
  $\sigma=o(n^{-2/d})$ and almost perfect recovery with a vanishing fraction of errors
  when $\sigma=o(n^{-1/d})$. Furthermore, these conditions are shown to be information-theoretically
  optimal even when the latent coordinates $\{X_i\}$ and $\{Y_i\}$ are observed, complementing
  the recent results of Dai et al. (2019) and Kunisky and Niles-Weed (2022) in geometric
  models of the planted bipartite matching problem. As a side discovery, we show that
  the celebrated  spectral algorithm of Umeyama (1988) emerges as a further approximation
  to the maximum likelihood  in the geometric model.
