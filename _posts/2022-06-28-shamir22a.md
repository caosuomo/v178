title: The Implicit Bias of Benign Overfitting
abstract: The phenomenon of benign overfitting, where a predictor perfectly fits noisy
  training data while attaining low expected loss, has received much attention in
  recent years, but still remains not fully understood beyond simple linear regression
  setups. In this paper, we show that for regression, benign overfitting is “biased”
  towards certain types of problems, in the sense that its existence on one learning
  problem precludes its existence on other learning problems. On the negative side,
  we use this to argue that one should not expect benign overfitting to occur in general,
  for several natural extensions of the plain linear regression problems studied so
  far. We then turn to classification problems, and show that the situation there
  is much more favorable. Specifically, we consider a model where an arbitrary input
  distribution of some fixed dimension k is concatenated with a high-dimensional distribution,
  and prove that the max-margin predictor (to which gradient-based methods are known
  to converge in direction) is asymptotically biased towards minimizing the expected
  \emph{squared hinge loss} w.r.t. the k-dimensional distribution. This allows us
  to reduce the question of benign overfitting in classification to the simpler question
  of whether this loss is a good surrogate for the misclassification error, and use
  it to show benign overfitting in some new settings.
