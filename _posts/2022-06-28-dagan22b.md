title: EM’s Convergence in Gaussian Latent Tree Models
abstract: We study the optimization landscape of the log-likelihood function and the
  convergence of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in latent Gaussian tree
  models, i.e. tree-structured Gaussian graphical models whose leaf nodes are observable
  and non-leaf nodes are unobservable. We show that the unique  non-trivial stationary
  point of the population log-likelihood is its global maximum, and establish that
  the expectation-maximization algorithm is guaranteed to converge to it in the single
  latent variable case. Our results for the landscape of the log-likelihood function
  in general latent tree models provide support for the extensive practical use of
  maximum likelihood based-methods in this setting. Our results for the expectation-maximization
  algorithm extend an emerging line of work on obtaining global convergence guarantees
  for this celebrated algorithm. We show our results for the non-trivial stationary
  points of the log-likelihood  by arguing that a certain system of polynomial equations
  obtained from the EM updates has a unique non-trivial solution. The global convergence
  of the EM algorithm follows by arguing that all trivial fixed points are higher-order
  saddle points.
