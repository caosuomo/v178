title: Toward Instance-Optimal State Certification With Incoherent Measurements
abstract: "We revisit the basic problem of quantum state certification: given copies
  of unknown mixed state ρ∈ℂ^{d×d} and the description of a mixed state σ, decide
  whether σ=ρ or ‖σ−ρ‖_\U0001D5CD\U0001D5CB ≥ ϵ. When σ is maximally mixed, this is
  mixedness testing, and it is known that Ω(d^{Θ(1)}/ϵ^2) copies are necessary, where
  the exact exponent depends on the type of measurements the learner can make [OW15,
  BCL20], and in many of these settings there is a matching upper bound [OW15, BOW19,
  BCL20]. Can one avoid this d^{Θ(1)} dependence for certain kinds of mixed states
  σ, e.g. ones which are approximately low rank? More ambitiously, does there exist
  a simple functional f : ℂ^{d×d} → ℝ_{≥0} for which one can show that Θ(f(σ)/ϵ^2)
  copies are necessary and sufficient for state certification with respect to any
  σ? Such instance-optimal bounds are known in the context of classical distribution
  testing, e.g. [VV17]. Here we give the first bounds of this nature for the quantum
  setting, showing (up to log factors) that the copy complexity for state certification
  using nonadaptive incoherent measurements is essentially given by the copy complexity
  for mixedness testing times the fidelity between σ and the maximally mixed state.
  Surprisingly, our bound differs substantially from instance optimal bounds for the
  classical problem, demonstrating a qualitative difference between the two settings."
