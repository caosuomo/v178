title: Sharp Constants in Uniformity Testing via the Huber Statistic
abstract: 'Uniformity testing is one of the most well-studied problems in property
  testing, with many known test statistics, including ones based on counting collisions,
  singletons, and the empirical TV distance.  It is known that the optimal sample
  complexity to distinguish the uniform distribution on $m$ elements from any $\eps$-far
  distribution with $1-\delta$ probability is $n = \Theta(\frac{\sqrt{m \log (1/\delta)}}{\eps^2}
  + \frac{\log (1/\delta)}{\eps^2})$, which is achieved by the empirical TV tester.  Yet
  in simulation, these theoretical analyses are misleading: in many cases, they do
  not correctly rank order the performance of existing testers, even in an asymptotic
  regime of all parameters tending to $0$ or $\infty$. We explain this discrepancy
  by studying the \emph{constant factors} required by the algorithms.  We show that
  the collisions tester achieves a sharp maximal constant in the number of standard
  deviations of separation between uniform and non-uniform inputs.  We then introduce
  a new tester based on the Huber loss, and show that it not only matches this separation,
  but also has tails corresponding to a Gaussian with this separation.  This leads
  to a sample complexity of $(1 + o(1))\frac{\sqrt{m \log (1/\delta)}}{\eps^2}$ in
  the regime where this term is dominant, unlike all other existing testers.'
