title: Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning in the Presence of Exogenous Information
abstract: In real-world reinforcement learning applications the learner’s observation
  space is ubiquitously high-dimensional with both relevant and irrelevant information
  about the task at hand. Learning from high-dimensional observations has been the
  subject of extensive investigation in supervised learning and statistics (e.g.,
  via sparsity), but analogous issues in reinforcement learning are not well understood,
  even in finite state/action (tabular) domains. We introduce a new problem setting
  for reinforcement learning, the Exogenous Markov Decision Process (ExMDP), in which
  the state space admits an (unknown) factorization into a small controllable (or,
  endogenous) component and a large irrelevant (or, exogenous) component; the exogenous
  component is independent of the learner’s actions, but evolves in an arbitrary,
  temporally correlated fashion. We provide a new algorithm, OSSR, which learns a
  near-optimal policy with sample complexity polynomial in the size of the endogenous
  component and nearly independent of the size of the exogenous component, thereby
  offering a doubly-exponential improvement over off-the-shelf algorithms. Our results
  highlight for the first time that sample-efficient reinforcement learning is possible
  in the presence of exogenous information, and provide a simple, user-friendly benchmark
  for investigation going forward.
