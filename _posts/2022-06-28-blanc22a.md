title: On the power of adaptivity in statistical adversaries
abstract: We initiate the study of a fundamental question concerning adversarial noise
  models in statistical problems where the algorithm receives i.i.d. draws from a
  distribution $\mathcal{D}$. The definitions of these adversaries specify the {\sl
  type} of allowable corruptions (noise model) as well as {\sl when} these corruptions
  can be made (adaptivity); the latter differentiates between oblivious adversaries
  that can only corrupt the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ and adaptive adversaries that
  can have their corruptions depend on the specific sample $S$ that is drawn from
  $\mathcal{D}$. We investigate whether oblivious adversaries are effectively equivalent
  to adaptive adversaries, across all noise models studied in the literature, under
  a unifying framework that we introduce. Specifically, can the behavior of an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$
  in the presence of oblivious adversaries always be well-approximated by that of
  an algorithm $\mathcal{A}’$ in the presence of adaptive adversaries? Our first result
  shows that this is indeed the case for the broad class of  {\sl statistical query}
  algorithms, under all reasonable noise models. We then show that in the specific
  case of {\sl additive noise}, this equivalence holds for {\sl all} algorithms. Finally,
  we map out an approach towards proving this statement in its fullest generality,
  for all algorithms and under all reasonable noise models.
