title: Learning to Control Linear Systems can be Hard
abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical difficulty of learning to control
  linear systems. We focus on two standard benchmarks, the sample complexity of stabilization,
  and the regret of the online learning of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Prior
  results state that the statistical difficulty for both benchmarks scales polynomially
  with the system state dimension up to system-theoretic quantities. However, this
  does not reveal the whole picture. By utilizing minimax lower bounds for both benchmarks,
  we prove that there exist non-trivial classes of systems for which learning complexity
  scales dramatically, i.e. exponentially, with the system dimension. This situation
  arises in the case of underactuated systems, i.e. systems with fewer inputs than
  states. Such systems are structurally difficult to control and their system theoretic
  quantities can scale exponentially with the system dimension dominating learning
  complexity. Under some additional structural assumptions (bounding systems away
  from uncontrollability), we provide qualitatively matching upper bounds. We prove
  that learning complexity can be at most exponential with the controllability index
  of the system, that is the degree of underactuation.
