title: Universality of empirical risk minimization
abstract: Consider supervised learning from i.i.d. samples {(y_i, x_i )}_{i≤n} where
  x_i ∈ R_p are feature vectors and y_i ∈ R are labels. We study empirical risk minimization
  over a class of functions that are parameterized by k = O(1) vectors θ_1 , . . .
  , θ_k ∈ R_p, and prove universality results both for the training and test error.
  Namely, under the proportional asymptotics n, p → ∞ , with n/p = Θ(1), we prove
  that the training error depends on the random features distribution only through
  its covariance structure. Further, we prove that the minimum test error over near-empirical
  risk minimizers enjoys similar universality properties. In particular, the asymptotics
  of these quantities can be computed —to leading order— under a simpler model in
  which the feature vectors x_i are replaced by Gaussian vectors g_i with the same
  covariance. Earlier universality results were limited to strongly convex learning
  procedures, or to feature vectors x_i with independent entries. Our results do not
  make any of these assumptions.  Our assumptions are general enough to include feature
  vectors x_i that are produced by randomized featurization maps. In particular we
  explicitly check the assumptions for certain random features models (computing the
  output of a one-layer neural network with random weights) and neural tangent models
  (first-order Taylor approximation of two-layer networks).
