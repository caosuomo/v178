title: 'Faster online calibration without randomization: interval forecasts and the
  power of two choices'
abstract: We study the problem of making calibrated probabilistic forecasts for a
  binary sequence generated by an adversarial nature. Following the seminal paper
  of Foster and Vohra (1998), nature is often modeled as an adaptive adversary who
  sees all activity of the forecaster except the randomization that the forecaster
  may deploy. A number of papers have proposed randomized forecasting strategies that
  achieve an $\epsilon$-calibration error rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which we prove
  is tight in general. On the other hand, it is well known that it is not possible
  to be calibrated without randomization, or if nature also sees the forecaster’s
  randomization; in both cases the calibration error could be $\Omega(1)$. Inspired
  by the equally seminal works on the power of two choices and imprecise probability
  theory, we study a small variant of the standard online calibration problem. The
  adversary gives the forecaster the option of making two nearby probabilistic forecasts,
  or equivalently an interval forecast of small width, and the endpoint closest to
  the revealed outcome is used to judge calibration. This power of two choices, or
  imprecise forecast, accords the forecaster with significant power—we show that a
  faster $\epsilon$-calibration rate of $O(1/T)$ can be achieved even without deploying
  any randomization.
