title: Exact Community Recovery in Correlated Stochastic Block Models
abstract: We consider the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple
  correlated networks. We study edge-correlated stochastic block models with two balanced
  communities, focusing on the regime where the average degree is logarithmic in the
  number of vertices. Our main result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold
  for exact community recovery using multiple correlated graphs. This threshold captures
  the interplay between the community recovery and graph matching tasks. In particular,
  we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact community
  recovery is possible using multiple correlated graphs, even though (1) this is information-theoretically
  impossible using a single graph and (2) exact graph matching is also information-theoretically
  impossible. In this regime, we develop a novel algorithm that carefully synthesizes
  algorithms from the community recovery and graph matching literatures.
