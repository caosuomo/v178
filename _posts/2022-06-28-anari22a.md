title: From Sampling to Optimization on Discrete Domains with Applications to Determinant
  Maximization
abstract: We establish a connection between sampling and optimization on discrete
  domains. For a family of distributions $\mu$ defined on size $k$ subsets of a ground
  set of elements, that is closed under external fields, we show that rapid mixing
  of natural local random walks implies the existence of simple approximation algorithms
  to find $\max \mu(\cdot)$. More precisely, we show that if $t$-step down-up random
  walks have spectral gap at least inverse polynomially large, then $t$-step local
  search finds $\max \mu(\cdot)$ within a factor of $k^{O(k)}$. As the main application
  of our result, we show that $2$-step local search achieves a nearly-optimal $k^{O(k)}$-factor
  approximation for MAP inference on nonsymmetric $k$-DPPs. This is the first nontrivial
  multiplicative approximation algorithm for this problem. In our main technical result,
  we show that an exchange inequality, a concept rooted in discrete convex analysis,
  can be derived from fast mixing of local random walks. We further advance the state
  of the art on the mixing of random walks for nonsymmetric DPPs and more generally
  sector-stable distributions, by obtaining the tightest possible bound on the step
  size needed for polynomial-time mixing of random walks. We bring the step size down
  by a factor of $2$ compared to prior works, and consequently get a quadratic improvement
  on the runtime of local search steps; this improvement is potentially of independent
  interest in sampling applications.
