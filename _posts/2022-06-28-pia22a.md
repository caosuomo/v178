title: Clustering with Queries under Semi-Random Noise
abstract: The seminal paper by Mazumdar and Saha (2017a) introduced an extensive line
  of work on clustering with noisy queries. Yet, despite significant progress on the
  problem, the proposed methods depend crucially on knowing the exact probabilities
  of errors of the underlying fully-random oracle.  In this work, we develop robust
  learning methods that tolerate general semi-random noise obtaining qualitatively
  the same guarantees as the best possible methods in the fully-random model. More
  specifically, given a set of n points with an unknown underlying partition, we are
  allowed to query pairs of points u,v to check if they are in the same cluster, but
  with probability p, the answer may be adversarially chosen. We show that information
  theoretically O(nk log n /(1-2p)^2) queries suffice to learn any cluster of sufficiently
  large size. Our main result is a computationally efficient algorithm that can identify
  large clusters with O(nk log n/ (1-2p)^2) + poly(log n, k, 1/(1-2p)) queries, matching
  the guarantees of the best known algorithms in the fully-random model. As a corollary
  of our approach, we develop the first parameter-free algorithm for the fully-random
  model, answering an open question in Mazumdar and Saha (2017a).
