title: Tracking Most Significant Arm Switches in Bandits
abstract: 'In \emph{bandit with distribution shifts}, one aims to automatically adapt
  to unknown changes in reward distribution, and \emph{restart} exploration when necessary.
  While this problem has been studied for many years, a recent breakthrough of Auer
  et al. (2018, 2019) provides the first adaptive procedure to guarantee an optimal
  (dynamic) regret $\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, and an unknown number $L$ of changes.
  However, while this rate is tight in the worst case, it remained open whether faster
  rates are possible, without prior knowledge, if few changes in distribution are
  actually \emph{severe}. To resolve this question, we propose a new notion of \emph{significant
  shift}, which only counts very severe changes that clearly necessitate a restart:
  roughly, these are changes involving not only best arm switches, but also involving
  large aggregate differences in reward overtime. Thus, our resulting procedure adaptively
  achieves rates  always faster (sometimes significantly) than $O(\sqrt{ST})$, where
  $S\ll L$ only counts best arm switches, while at the same time, always faster than
  the optimal $O(V^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ when expressed in terms of \emph{total
  variation} $V$ (which aggregates differences overtime). Our results are expressed
  in enough generality to also capture non-stochastic adversarial settings.'
