title: Efficient  decentralized multi-agent learning in asymmetric queuing systems
abstract: We study decentralized multi-agent learning in bipartite queuing systems,
  a standard model for service systems. In particular, N agents request service from
  K servers in a fully decentralized way, i.e, by running the same algorithm without
  communication. Previous decentralized algorithms are restricted to symmetric systems,
  have performance that is degrading exponentially in the number of servers, require
  communication through shared randomness and unique agent identities, and are computationally
  demanding. In contrast, we provide a simple learning algorithm that, when run decentrally
  by each agent, leads the queueing system to have efficient performance in general
  asymmetric bipartite queuing systems while also having additional robustness properties.
  Along the way, we provide the first UCB-based algorithm for the centralized case
  of the problem, which resolves an open question by Krishnasamy et al.
