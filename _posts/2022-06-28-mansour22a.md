title: Strategizing against Learners in Bayesian Games
abstract: 'We study repeated two-player games where one of the players, the learner,
  employs a no-regret learning strategy, while the other, the optimizer, is a rational
  utility maximizer. We consider general Bayesian games, where the payoffs of both
  the optimizer and the learner could depend on the type, which is drawn from a publicly
  known distribution, but revealed privately to the learner. We address the following
  questions: (a) what is the bare minimum that the optimizer can guarantee to obtain
  regardless of the no-regret learning algorithm employed by the learner? (b) are
  there learning algorithms that cap the optimizer payoff at this minimum? (c) can
  these algorithms be implemented efficiently? While building this theory of optimizer-learner
  interactions, we define a new combinatorial notion of regret called polytope swap
  regret, that could be of independent interest in other settings.'
