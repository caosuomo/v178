title: Derivatives and residual distribution of regularized M-estimators with application
  to adaptive tuning
abstract: This paper studies M-estimators with gradient-Lipschitz loss function regularized
  with convex penalty in linear models with Gaussian design matrix and arbitrary noise
  distribution. A practical example is the robust M-estimator constructed with the
  Huber loss and the Elastic-Net penalty and the noise distribution has heavy-tails.
  Our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We provide general formulae for the derivatives
  of regularized M-estimators $\hat\beta(y,X)$ where differentiation is taken with
  respect to both X and y; this reveals a simple differentiability structure shared
  by all convex regularized M-estimators. (ii) Using these derivatives, we characterize
  the distribution of the residuals in the intermediate high-dimensional regime where
  dimension and sample size are of the same order. (iii) Motivated by the distribution
  of the residuals, we propose a novel adaptive criterion to select tuning parameters
  of regularized M-estimators. The criterion approximates the out-of-sample error
  up to an additive constant independent of the estimator, so that minimizing the
  criterion provides a proxy for minimizing the out-of-sample error. The proposed
  adaptive criterion does not require the knowledge of the noise distribution or of
  the covariance of the design. Simulated data confirms the theoretical findings,
  regarding both the distribution of the residuals and the success of the criterion
  as a proxy of the out-of-sample error. Finally our results reveal new relationships
  between the derivatives of the $\hat\beta$ and the effective degrees of freedom
  of the M-estimators, which are of independent interest.
