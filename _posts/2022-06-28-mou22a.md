title: Optimal and instance-dependent guarantees for Markovian linear stochastic approximation
abstract: We study stochastic approximation procedures for approximately solving a
  $d$-dimensional linear fixed point equation based on observing a trajectory of length
  $n$ from an ergodic Markov chain.  We first exhibit a non-asymptotic bound of the
  order $t_{\mathrm{mix}} \tfrac{d}{n}$ on the squared error of the last iterate of
  a standard scheme, where $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is a mixing time.  We then prove a non-asymptotic
  instance-dependent bound on a suitably averaged sequence of iterates, with a leading
  term that matches the local asymptotic minimax limit, including sharp dependence
  on the parameters $(d, t_{\mathrm{mix}})$ in the higher order terms. We complement
  these upper bounds with a non-asymptotic minimax lower bound that establishes the
  instance-optimality of the averaged SA estimator. We derive corollaries of these
  results for policy evaluation with Markov noise—covering the TD($\lambda$) family
  of algorithms for all $\lambda \in [0, 1)$—and linear autoregressive models. Our
  instance-dependent characterizations open the door to the design of fine-grained
  model selection procedures for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., choosing the value of
  $\lambda$ when running the TD($\lambda$) algorithm).
