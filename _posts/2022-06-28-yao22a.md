title: Mean-field nonparametric estimation of interacting particle systems
abstract: This paper concerns the nonparametric estimation problem of the distribution-state
  dependent drift vector field in an interacting $N$-particle system. Observing single-trajectory
  data for each particle, we derive the mean-field rate of convergence for the maximum
  likelihood estimator (MLE), which depends on both Gaussian complexity and Rademacher
  complexity of the function class. In particular, when the function class contains
  $\alpha$-smooth H{รถ}lder functions, our rate of convergence is minimax optimal on
  the order of $N^{-\frac{\alpha}{d+2\alpha}}$. Combining with a Fourier analytical
  deconvolution estimator, we derive the consistency of MLE for the external force
  and interaction kernel in the McKean-Vlasov equation.
