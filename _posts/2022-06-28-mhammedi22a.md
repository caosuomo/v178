title: Efficient Projection-Free Online Convex Optimization with Membership Oracle
abstract: In constrained convex optimization, existing interior point methods do not
  scale well with the dimension of the ambient space. Alternative approaches such
  as Projected Gradient Descent only provide a computational benefit for simple convex
  sets where Euclidean projections can be performed efficiently, such as Euclidean
  balls. For other more complex sets, the cost of the projections can be too high.
  To circumvent these issues, alternative methods based on the famous Frank-Wolfe
  algorithm have been studied and widely used. Such methods use a Linear Optimization
  Oracle at each iteration instead of Euclidean projections; the former can often
  be performed efficiently. Such methods have also been extended to the online and
  stochastic optimization settings. However, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants
  do not achieve the optimal performance, in terms of regret or rate, for general
  convex sets. What is more, the Linear Optimization Oracle they use can still be
  computationally expensive in some cases. In this paper, we move away from Frank-Wolfe
  style algorithms and present a new reduction that turns any algorithm $\mathsf{A}$
  over a Euclidean ball (where projections are cheap) to an algorithm over a general
  convex constraint set $\mathcal{C}$ contained within the ball, without sacrificing
  the performance of the original algorithm $\mathsf{A}$ by much. Our reduction requires
  $O(T \ln T)$ calls to a Membership Oracle on $\mathcal{C}$ after $T$ rounds, and
  no linear optimization on $\K$ is needed. Using this reduction, we recover optimal
  regret bounds [resp. rates], in terms of the number of iterations, in online [resp. stochastic]
  convex optimization. Our guarantees are also useful in the offline convex optimization
  setting when the dimension of the ambient space is large.
