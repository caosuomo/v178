title: Private Convex Optimization via Exponential Mechanism
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the private optimization problems for non-smooth
  convex functions $F(x)=\mathbb{E}_i f_i(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that modifying
  the exponential mechanism by adding an $\ell_2^2$ regularizer to $F(x)$ and sampling
  from $\pi(x)\propto \exp(-k(F(x)+\mu\|x\|_2^2/2))$ recovers both the known optimal
  empirical risk and population loss under $(\eps,\delta)$-DP. Furthermore, we show
  how to implement this mechanism using $\widetilde{O}(n \min(d, n))$ queries to $f_i(x)$
  where $n$ is the number of samples/users in the DP-SCO. We also give a (nearly)
  matching lower bound $\widetilde{\Omega}(n \min(d, n))$ on the number of evaluation
  queries. Our results utilize the following tools that are of independent interests:
  \begin{itemize} \item We prove Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) of the exponential
  mechanism if the loss function is strongly convex and the perturbation is Lipschitz.
  Our privacy bound is \emph{optimal} as it includes the privacy of Gaussian mechanism
  as a special case. \item We show how to sample from $\exp(-F(x)-\mu \|x\|^2_2/2)$
  for $G$-Lipschitz $F$ with $\eta$ error in TV distance using $\widetilde{O}((G^2/\mu)
  \log^2(d/\eta))$ unbiased queries to $F(x)$. This is the first sampler whose query
  complexity has \emph{polylogarithmic dependence} on both dimension $d$ and accuracy
  $\eta$. \end{itemize}'
