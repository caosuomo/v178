title: Efficient Online Linear Control with Stochastic Convex Costs and Unknown Dynamics
abstract: We consider the problem of controlling an unknown linear dynamical system
  under a stochastic convex cost and full feedback of both the state and cost function.
  We present a computationally efficient algorithm that attains an optimal $\sqrt{T}$
  regret-rate against the best stabilizing linear controller. In contrast to previous
  work, our algorithm is based on the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty paradigm.
  This results in a substantially improved computational complexity and a simpler
  analysis.
