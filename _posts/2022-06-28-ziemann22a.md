title: Single Trajectory Nonparametric Learning of Nonlinear Dynamics
abstract: Given a single trajectory of a dynamical system, we analyze the performance
  of the nonparametric least squares estimator (LSE). More precisely, we give nonasymptotic
  expected $l^2$-distance bounds between the LSE and the true regression function,
  where expectation is evaluated on a fresh, counterfactual, trajectory. We leverage
  recently developed information-theoretic methods to establish the optimality of
  the LSE for nonparametric hypotheses classes  in terms of supremum norm metric entropy
  and a subgaussian parameter. Next, we relate this subgaussian parameter to the stability
  of the underlying process using notions from dynamical systems theory. When combined,
  these developments lead to rate-optimal error bounds that scale as $T^{-1/(2+q)}$
  for suitably stable processes and hypothesis classes with metric entropy growth
  of order $\delta^{-q}$. Here,  $T$ is the length of the observed trajectory, $\delta
  \in \mathbb{R}_+$ is the packing granularity and $q\in (0,2)$ is a complexity term.
  Finally, we specialize our results to a number of scenarios of practical interest,
  such as Lipschitz dynamics, generalized linear models, and dynamics described by
  functions in certain classes of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS).
