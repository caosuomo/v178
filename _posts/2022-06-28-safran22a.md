title: Optimization-Based Separations for Neural Networks
abstract: Depth separation results propose a possible theoretical explanation for
  the benefits of deep neural networks over shallower architectures, establishing
  that the former possess superior approximation capabilities. However, there are
  no known results in which the deeper architecture leverages this advantage into
  a provable optimization guarantee. We prove that when the data are generated by
  a distribution with radial symmetry which satisfies some mild assumptions, gradient
  descent can efficiently learn ball indicator functions using a depth 2 neural network
  with two layers of sigmoidal activations, and where the hidden layer is held fixed
  throughout training. By building on and refining existing techniques for approximation
  lower bounds of neural networks with a single layer of non-linearities, we show
  that there are $d$-dimensional radial distributions on the data such that ball indicators
  cannot be learned efficiently by any algorithm to accuracy better than $\Omega(d^{-4})$,
  nor by a standard gradient descent implementation to accuracy better than a constant.
  These results establish what is to the best of our knowledge, the first optimization-based
  separations where the approximation benefits of the stronger architecture provably
  manifest in practice. Our proof technique introduces new tools and ideas that may
  be of independent interest in the theoretical study of both the approximation and
  optimization of neural networks.
