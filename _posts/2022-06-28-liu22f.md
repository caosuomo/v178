title: When Is Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning Not Scary?
abstract: Partial observability is ubiquitous in applications of Reinforcement Learning
  (RL), in which agents learn to make a sequence of decisions despite lacking complete
  information about the latent states of the controlled system. Partially observable
  RL is notoriously difficult in theory—well-known complexity-theoretic results show
  that learning partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires an
  exponential number of samples in the worst case.  Yet, this does not rule out the
  possible existence of interesting subclasses of POMDPs, which include a large set
  of partial observable applications in practice while being tractable. In this paper
  we identify a rich family of tractable POMDPs, which we call weakly revealing POMDPs.
  This family rules out the pathological instances of POMDPs with non-informative
  observations. We prove that for weakly revealing POMDPs, a simple algorithm combining
  optimism and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is sufficient to guarantee a polynomial
  sample complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provably sample-efficient
  result for learning in overcomplete POMDPs—where the number of latent states can
  be larger than the number of observations—in settings where exploration is necessary.
