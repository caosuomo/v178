title: Approximate Cluster Recovery from Noisy Labels
abstract: Designing algorithms for machine learning problems targeting beyond worst-case
  analysis and, in particular, analyzing the effect of side-information on the complexity
  of such problems is a very important line of research with many practical applications.
  In this paper we study the classic k-means clustering problem in the presence of
  noisy labels.  In this problem, in addition to a set of points and parameter \(k\),
  we receive cluster labels of each point generated by either an adversarial or a
  random perturbation of the optimal solution. Our main goal is to formally study
  the effect of this extra information on the complexity of the k-means problem. In
  particular, in the context of random perturbations, we give an efficient algorithm
  that finds a clustering of cost within a factor $1+o(1)$ of the optimum even when
  the label of each point is perturbed with a large probability (think 99%). In contrast,
  we show that the side-information with adversarial perturbations is as hard as the
  original problem even if only a small $\epsilon$ fraction of the labels are  perturbed.
  We complement this negative result by giving a simple algorithm in the case when
  the adversary is only allowed to perturb an $\epsilon$ fraction of the labels per
  \emph{each cluster}.
