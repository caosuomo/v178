title: Private Robust Estimation by Stabilizing Convex Relaxations
abstract: 'We give the first polynomial time and sample (epsilon, delta)-differentially
  private (DP) algorithm to estimate the mean, covariance and higher moments in the
  presence of a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Our algorithm succeeds
  for families of distributions that satisfy two well-studied properties in prior
  works on robust estimation: certifiable subgaussianity of directional moments and
  certifiable hypercontractivity of degree 2 polynomials. Our recovery guarantees
  hold in the “right affine-invariant norms”: Mahalanobis distance for mean, multiplicative
  spectral and relative Frobenius distance guarantees for covariance and injective
  norms for higher moments. Prior works obtained private robust algorithms for mean
  estimation of subgaussian distributions with bounded covariance. For covariance
  estimation, ours is the first efficient algorithm (even in the absence of outliers)
  that succeeds without any condition-number assumptions. Our algorithms arise from
  a new framework that provides a general blueprint for modifying convex relaxations
  for robust estimation to satisfy strong worst-case stability guarantees in the appropriate
  parameter norms whenever the algorithms produce witnesses of correctness in their
  run. We verify such guarantees for a modification of standard sum-of-squares (SoS)
  semidefinite programming relaxations for robust estimation. Our privacy guarantees
  are obtained by combining stability guarantees with a new “estimate dependent” noise
  injection mechanism in which noise scales with the eigenvalues of the estimated
  covariance. We believe this framework will be useful more generally in obtaining
  DP counterparts of robust estimators. Independently of our work, Ashtiani and Liaw
  [AL21] also obtained a polynomial time and sample private robust estimation algorithm
  for Gaussian distributions.'
