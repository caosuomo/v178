title: Private High-Dimensional Hypothesis Testing
abstract: We provide improved differentially private algorithms for identity testing
  of high-dimensional distributions. Specifically, for $d$-dimensional Gaussian distributions
  with known covariance $\Sigma$, we can test whether the distribution comes from
  $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ for some fixed $\mu^*$ or from some $\mathcal{N}(\mu,
  \Sigma)$ with total variation distance at least $\alpha$ from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*,
  \Sigma)$ with $(\varepsilon, 0)$-differential privacy, using only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2}
  + \frac{d^{1/3}}{\alpha^{4/3} \cdot \varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{1}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon}\right)\]{samples}
  if the algorithm is allowed to be computationally inefficient, and only  \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2}
  + \frac{d^{1/4}}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon}\right)\]{samples} for a computationally
  efficient algorithm. We also provide a matching lower bound showing that our computationally
  inefficient algorithm has optimal sample complexity. We also extend our algorithms
  to various related problems, including mean testing of Gaussians with bounded but
  unknown covariance, uniformity testing of product distributions over $\{-1, 1\}^d$,
  and tolerant testing. Our results improve over the previous best work of Canonne
  et al. (2020) for both computationally efficient and inefficient algorithms, and
  even our computationally efficient algorithm matches the optimal \emph{non-private}
  sample complexity of $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\alpha^2}\right)$ in many standard
  parameter settings.  In addition, our results show that, surprisingly, private identity
  testing of $d$-dimensional Gaussians can be done with fewer samples than private
  identity testing of discrete distributions over a domain of size $d$ (Acharya et
  al., 2018), which refutes a conjectured lower bound of Canonne et al. (2020).
