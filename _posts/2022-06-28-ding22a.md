title: Fast algorithm for overcomplete order-3 tensor decomposition
abstract: We develop the first fast spectral algorithm to decompose a random third-order
  tensor over of rank up to $$O(d^{3/2}/polylog(d))$$. Our algorithm only involves
  simple linear algebra operations and can recover all components in time $$O(d^{6.05})$$
  under the current matrix multiplication time. Prior to this work, comparable guarantees
  could only be achieved via sum-of-squares [Ma, Shi, Steurer 2016]. In contrast,
  fast algorithms [Hopkins, Schramm, Shi, Steurer 2016] could only decompose tensors
  of rank at most $$O(d^{4/3}/polylog(d))$$. Our algorithmic result rests on two key
  ingredients. A clean lifting of the third-order tensor to a sixth-order tensor,
  which can be expressed in the language of tensor networks. A careful decomposition
  of the tensor network into a sequence of rectangular matrix multiplications, which
  allows us to have a fast implementation of the algorithm.
