title: 'High-Dimensional Projection Pursuit: Outer Bounds and Applications to Interpolation
  in Neural Networks'
abstract: Given a cloud of $n$ data points in $\R^d$, consider all projections onto
  $m$-dimensional subspaces of $\R^d$ and,  for each such projection, the empirical
  distribution of the projected points. What does this collection of probability distributions
  look like when $n,d$ grow large? We consider this question under the null model
  in which the points are i.i.d.  standard Gaussian vectors, focusing on the asymptotic
  regime in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n/d\to\alpha\in (0,\infty)$, while $m$ is
  fixed. Denoting by $\cuF_{m, \alpha}$ the set of probability distributions in $\R^m$
  that arise as low-dimensional projections in this limit, we establish new outer
  bounds on $\cuF_{m, \alpha}$. In particular, we characterize the radius of $\cuF_{m,\alpha}$
  in terms of Wasserstein distance  and prove sharp bounds in terms of Kullback-Leibler
  divergence and RÃ©nyi information dimension. The previous question has application
  to unsupervised learning methods, such as projection pursuit and independent component
  analysis. We introduce a version of the same problem that is relevant for  supervised
  learning, and prove a sharp Wasserstein radius bound. As an application, we establish
  an upper bound on the interpolation threshold of two-layers neural networks with
  $m$ hidden neurons.
