title: Rate-Distortion Theoretic Generalization Bounds for Stochastic Learning Algorithms
abstract: Understanding generalization in modern machine learning settings has been
  one of the major challenges in statistical learning theory. In this context, recent
  years have witnessed the development of various generalization bounds suggesting
  different complexity notions such as the mutual information between the data sample
  and the algorithm output, compressibility of the hypothesis space, and the fractal
  dimension of the hypothesis space. While these bounds have illuminated the problem
  at hand from different angles, their suggested complexity notions might appear seemingly
  unrelated, thereby restricting their high-level impact. In this study, we prove
  novel generalization bounds through the lens of rate-distortion theory, and explicitly
  relate the concepts of mutual information, compressibility, and fractal dimensions
  in a single mathematical framework. Our approach consists of (i) defining a generalized
  notion of compressibility by using source coding concepts, and (ii) showing that
  the ’compression error rate’ can be linked to the generalization error both in expectation
  and with high probability. We show that in the ’lossless compression’ setting, we
  recover and improve existing mutual information-based bounds, whereas a ’lossy compression’
  scheme allows us to link generalization to the rate-distortion dimension - a particular
  notion of fractal dimension. Our results bring a more unified perspective on generalization
  and open up several future research directions.
