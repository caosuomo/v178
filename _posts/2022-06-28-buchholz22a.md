title: Kernel interpolation in Sobolev spaces is not consistent in low dimensions
abstract: We consider kernel ridgeless ridge regression with kernels whose associated
  RKHS is a Sobolev space $H^s$. We show for  $d/2<s<3d/4$ that interpolation is not
  consistent in  fixed dimension  extending earlier results for the Laplace kernel
  in odd dimensions and underlining again that benign overfitting is rare in low dimensions.
  The proof proceeds by deriving sharp bounds on the spectrum of random kernel matrices
  using results from the theory of radial basis functions which might be of independent
  interest.
