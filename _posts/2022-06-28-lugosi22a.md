title: Generalization Bounds via Convex Analysis
abstract: Since the celebrated works of Russo and Zou (2016, 2019) and Xu and Raginsky
  (2017), it has been well known that the generalization error of supervised learning
  algorithms can be bounded in terms of the mutual information between their input
  and the output, given that the loss of any fixed hypothesis has a subgaussian tail.
  In this work, we generalize this result beyond the standard choice of Shannonâ€™s
  mutual information to measure the dependence between the input and the output. Our
  main result shows that it is indeed possible to replace the mutual information by
  any strongly convex function of the joint input-output distribution, with the subgaussianity
  condition on the losses replaced by a bound on an appropriately chosen norm capturing
  the geometry of the dependence measure. This allows us to derive a range of generalization
  bounds that are either entirely new or strengthen previously known ones. Examples
  include bounds stated in terms of p-norm divergences and the Wasserstein-2 distance,
  which are respectively applicable for heavy-tailed loss distributions and highly
  smooth loss functions. Our analysis is entirely based on elementary tools from convex
  analysis by tracking the growth of a potential function associated with the dependence
  measure and the loss function.
