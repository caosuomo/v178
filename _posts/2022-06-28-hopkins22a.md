title: Realizable Learning is All You Need
abstract: 'The equivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability is a fundamental
  phenomenon in learning theory. With variants ranging from classical settings like
  PAC learning and regression to recent trends such as adversarially robust and private
  learning, itâ€™s surprising we still lack a unified theory; traditional proofs of
  the equivalence tend to be disparate, and rely on strong model-specific assumptions
  like uniform convergence and sample compression.  In this work, we give the first
  model-independent framework explaining the equivalence of realizable and agnostic
  learnability: a three-line blackbox reduction that simplifies, unifies, and extends
  our understanding across a wide variety of settings. This includes models with no
  known characterization of learnability such as learning with arbitrary distributional
  assumptions or general loss, as well as a host of other popular settings such as
  robust learning, partial learning, fair learning, and the statistical query model.
  More generally, we argue that the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learning
  is actually a special case of a broader phenomenon we call property generalization:
  any desirable property of a learning algorithm (e.g. noise tolerance, privacy, stability)
  that can be satisfied over finite hypothesis classes extends (possibly in some variation)
  to any learnable hypothesis class.'
