title: Tight query complexity bounds for learning graph partitions
abstract: Given a partition of a graph into connected components, the membership oracle
  asserts whether any two vertices of the graph lie in the same component or not.
  We prove that for $n\ge k\ge 2$, learning the components of an $n$-vertex hidden
  graph with $k$ components requires at least $(k-1)n-\binom k2$ membership queries.
  Our result improves on the best known information-theoretic bound of $\Omega(n\log
  k)$ queries, and exactly matches the query complexity of the algorithm introduced
  by [Reyzin and Srivastava, 2007] for this problem. Additionally, we introduce an
  oracle that can learn the number of components of $G$ in asymptotically fewer queries
  than learning the full partition, thus answering another question posed by the same
  authors. Lastly, we introduce a more applicable version of this oracle, and prove
  asymptotically tight bounds of $\widetilde\Theta(m)$ queries for both learning and
  verifying an $m$-edge hidden graph $G$ using it.
