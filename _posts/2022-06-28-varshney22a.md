title: "(Nearly) Optimal Private Linear Regression for Sub-Gaussian Data via Adaptive
  Clipping"
abstract: 'We study the problem of differentially private linear regression where
  each of the data point is sampled from a fixed sub-Gaussian style distribution.
  We propose and analyze a one-pass  mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method
  (DP-AMBSSGD) where points in each iteration are sampled without  replacement. Noise
  is added for DP but the noise standard deviation is estimated online. Compared to
  existing $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP techniques which have  sub-optimal error bounds,
  DP-AMBSSGD is able to provide nearly optimal error bounds in terms of key parameters
  like dimensionality $d$, number of points $N$, and the standard deviation \sigma
  of the noise  in observations. For example, when the $d$-dimensional covariates
  are sampled i.i.d. from the normal distribution, then the excess error of DP-AMBSSGD
  due to privacy  is $\sigma^2 d/N(1+d/(\epsilon^2 N))$, i.e., the error is meaningful
  when number of samples N\geq d \log d which is the standard operative regime for
  linear regression. In contrast, error bounds for existing efficient methods in this
  setting are:  $d^3/(\epsilon^2 N^2)$, even for $\sigma=0$. That is, for constant
  $\epsilon$, the existing techniques require $N=d^{1.5}$ to provide a non-trivial
  result.'
