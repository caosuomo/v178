title: Minimax Regret Optimization for Robust Machine Learning under Distribution
  Shift
abstract: In this paper, we consider learning scenarios where the learned model is
  evaluated under an unknown test distribution which potentially differs from the
  training distribution (i.e. distribution shift). The learner has access to a family
  of weight functions such that the test distribution is a reweighting of the training
  distribution under one of these functions, a setting typically studied under the
  name of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).  We consider the problem of
  deriving regret bounds in the classical learning theory setting, and require that
  the resulting regret bounds hold uniformly for all potential test distributions.
  We show that the DRO formulation does not guarantee uniformly small regret under
  distribution shift. We instead propose an alternative method called Minimax Regret
  Optimization (MRO), and show that under suitable conditions, this method achieves
  uniformly low regret across all test distributions. We also adapt our technique
  to have strong guarantees when the test distributions are heterogeneous in their
  similarity to the training data.  Given the widespead optimization of worst case
  risks in current approaches to robust machine learning, we believe that MRO can
  be an attractive framework to address a broad range of distribution shift scenarios.
