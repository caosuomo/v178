title: 'Beyond No Regret: Instance-Dependent PAC Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: 'The theory of reinforcement learning has focused on two fundamental problems:
  achieving low regret, and identifying $\epsilon$-optimal policies. While a simple
  reduction allows one to apply a low-regret algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal
  policy and achieve the worst-case optimal rate, it is unknown whether low-regret
  algorithms can obtain the instance-optimal rate for policy identification. We show
  this is not possible—there exists a fundamental tradeoff between achieving low regret
  and identifying an $\epsilon$-optimal policy at the instance-optimal rate. Motivated
  by our negative finding, we propose a new measure of instance-dependent sample complexity
  for PAC tabular reinforcement learning which explicitly accounts for the attainable
  state visitation distributions in the underlying MDP. We then propose and analyze
  a novel, planning-based algorithm which attains this sample complexity—yielding
  a complexity which scales with the suboptimality gaps and the “reachability” of
  a state. We show our algorithm is nearly minimax optimal, and on several examples
  that our instance-dependent sample complexity offers significant improvements over
  worst-case bounds.'
