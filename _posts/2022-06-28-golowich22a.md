title: Can Q-learning be Improved with Advice?
abstract: Despite rapid progress in theoretical reinforcement learning (RL) over the
  last few years, most of the known guarantees are worst-case in nature, failing to
  take advantage of structure that may be known a priori about a given RL problem
  at hand. In this paper we address the question of whether worst-case lower bounds
  for regret in online learning of Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be circumvented
  when information about the MDP, in the form of predictions about its optimal Q-value
  function, is given to the algorithm. We show that when the predictions about the
  optimal Q-value function satisfy a reasonably weak condition we call distillation,
  then we can improve regret bounds by replacing the set of state-action pairs with
  the set of state-action pairs on which the predictions are grossly inaccurate. This
  improvement holds for both uniform regret bounds and gap-based ones. Further, we
  are able to achieve this property with an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret
  when given arbitrary predictions (i.e., even those which are not a distillation).
  Our work extends a recent line of work on algorithms with predictions, which has
  typically focused on simple online problems such as caching and scheduling, to the
  more complex and general problem of reinforcement learning.
