title: Scale-free Unconstrained Online Learning for Curved Losses
abstract: 'A sequence of works in unconstrained online convex optimisation have investigated
  the possibility of adapting simultaneously to the norm U of the comparator and the
  maximum norm G of the gradients. In full generality, matching upper and lower bounds
  are known which show that this comes at the unavoidable cost of an additive GU^3,
  which is not needed when either G or U is known in advance. Surprisingly, recent
  results by Kempka et al. (2019) show that no such price for adaptivity is needed
  in the specific case of 1-Lipschitz losses like the hinge loss. We follow up on
  this observation by showing that there is in fact never a price to pay for adaptivity
  if we specialise to any of the other common supervised online learning losses: our
  results cover log loss, (linear and non-parametric) logistic regression, square
  loss prediction, and (linear and non-parametric) least-squares regression. We also
  fill in several gaps in the literature by providing matching lower bounds with an
  explicit dependence on U. In all cases we obtain scale-free algorithms, which are
  suitably invariant under rescaling of the data. Our general goal is to establish
  achievable rates without concern for computational efficiency, but for linear logistic
  regression we also provide an adaptive method that is as efficient as the recent
  non-adaptive algorithm by Agarwal et al. (2021).'
