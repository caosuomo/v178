title: The Dynamics of Riemannian Robbins-Monro Algorithms
abstract: Many important learning algorithms, such as stochastic gradient methods,
  are often deployed to solve nonlinear problems on Riemannian manifolds. Motivated
  by these applications, we propose a family of Riemannian algorithms generalizing
  and extending the seminal stochastic approximation framework of Robbins and Monro
  (1951). Compared to their Euclidean counterparts, Riemannian iterative algorithms
  are much less understood due to the lack of a global linear structure on the manifold.
  We overcome this difficulty by introducing an extended Fermi coordinate frame which
  allows us to map the asymptotic behavior of the proposed Riemannian Robbinsâ€“Monro
  (RRM) class of algorithms to that of an associated deterministic dynamical system
  under very mild assumptions on the underlying manifold. In so doing, we provide
  a general template of almost sure convergence results that mirrors and extends the
  existing theory for Euclidean Robbins-Monro schemes, albeit with a significantly
  more involved analysis that requires a number of new geometric ingredients. We showcase
  the flexibility of the proposed RRM framework by using it to establish the convergence
  of a retraction-based analogue of the popular optimistic / extra-gradient methods
  for solving minimization problems and games, and we provide a unified treatment
  for their convergence.
