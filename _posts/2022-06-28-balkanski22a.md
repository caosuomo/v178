title: Learning Low Degree Hypergraphs
abstract: We study the problem of learning a hypergraph via edge detecting queries.
  In this problem, a learner queries subsets of vertices of a hidden hypergraph and
  observes whether these subsets contain an edge or not. In general, learning a  hypergraph  with
  m edges of maximum size d requires Omega((2m/d)^{d/2}) queries. In this paper, we
  aim to identify families of hypergraphs that can be learned without suffering from
  a query complexity that grows exponentially in the size of the edges.  We show that
  hypermatchings and low-degree near-uniform hypergraphs with n vertices are learnable
  with poly(n) queries. For learning hypermatchings (hypergraphs of maximum degree
  Delta = 1), we give an O(log^3 n)-round  algorithm with O(n log^5 n) queries. We
  complement this upper bound by showing that there are no algorithms with poly(n)
  queries that learn hypermatchings in o(log log n) adaptive rounds. For hypergraphs
  with maximum degree Delta and edge size ratio rho, we give a non-adaptive algorithm
  with O((2n)^{rho Delta+1} log^2 n) queries. To the best of our knowledge, these
  are the first algorithms  with poly(n, m) query complexity for learning non-trivial
  families of hypergraphs that have  a super-constant number of edges of arbitrarily
  large size.
