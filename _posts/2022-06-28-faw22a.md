title: 'The Power of Adaptivity in SGD: Self-Tuning Step Sizes with Unbounded Gradients
  and Affine Variance'
abstract: 'We study convergence rates of AdaGrad-Norm as an exemplar of adaptive stochastic
  gradient methods (SGD), where the step sizes  change based on observed stochastic
  gradients, for minimizing non-convex, smooth objectives. Despite their popularity,
  the analysis of adaptive SGD lags behind that of non adaptive methods in this setting.
  Specifically, all prior works rely on some subset of the following assumptions:
  (i) uniformly-bounded gradient norms, (ii) uniformly-bounded stochastic gradient
  variance (or even noise support), (iii) conditional independence between the step
  size and stochastic gradient. In this work, we show that AdaGrad-Norm exhibits an
  order optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\mathrm{poly}\log(T)}{\sqrt{T}}\right)$
  after $T$ iterations under the same assumptions as optimally-tuned non adaptive
  SGD (unbounded gradient norms and affine noise variance scaling), and crucially,
  without needing any tuning parameters. We thus establish that adaptive gradient
  methods exhibit order-optimal convergence in much broader regimes than previously
  understood.'
