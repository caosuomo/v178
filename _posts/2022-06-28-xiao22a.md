title: 'Eigenspace Restructuring: A Principle of Space and Frequency in Neural Networks'
abstract: 'Understanding the fundamental principles behind the massive success of
  neural networks is one of the most important open questions in deep learning. However,
  due to the highly complex nature of the problem, progress has been relatively slow.
  In this note, through the lens of infinite-width networks, a.k.a. neural kernels,
  we present one such principle resulting from hierarchical localities. It is well-known
  that the eigenstructure of infinite-width multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) depends
  solely on the concept {\it frequency}, which measures the order of interactions.
  We show that the topologies from deep convolutional networks (CNNs) restructure
  the associated eigenspaces into finer subspaces. In addition to frequency, the new
  structure also depends on the concept {\it space}, which measures the spatial distance
  among nonlinear interaction terms. The resulting fine-grained eigenstructure dramatically
  improves the network’s learnability, empowering them to simultaneously model a much
  richer class of interactions.  including Long-Range-Low-Frequency interactions,
  Short-Range-High-Frequency interactions, and various interpolations and extrapolations
  in-between. Additionally, model scaling can improve the resolutions of interpolations
  and extrapolations and, therefore, the network’s learnability. Finally, we prove
  a sharp characterization of the generalization error for infinite-width CNNs (aka
  C-NTK and CNN-GP) of any depth in the high-dimensional setting. Two corollaries
  follow: (1) infinite-width deep CNNs can overcome the curse of dimensionality without
  losing their expressivity, and (2) scaling improves performance in both the finite
  and infinite data regimes.'
