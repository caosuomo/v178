title: On the well-spread property and its relation to linear regression
abstract: We consider the robust linear regression model $\bm{y} = X\beta^* + \bm{\eta}$,
  where an adversary oblivious to the design $X \in \R^{n \times d}$ may choose $\bm{\eta}$
  to corrupt all but a (possibly vanishing) fraction of the observations $\bm{y}$
  in an arbitrary way. Recent work \cite{d2021consistent, d2021consistentICML} has
  introduced efficient algorithms for consistent recovery of the parameter vector.
  These algorithms crucially rely on the design matrix being well-spread (a matrix
  is well-spread if its column span is far from any sparse vector). In this paper,
  we show that there exists a family of design matrices lacking well-spreadness such
  that consistent recovery of the parameter vector in the above robust linear regression
  model is information-theoretically impossible.  We further investigate the average-case
  time complexity of certifying well-spreadness of random matrices. We show that it
  is possible to efficiently certify whether a given $n$-by-$d$ Gaussian matrix is
  well-spread if the number of observations is quadratic in the ambient dimension.
  We complement this result by showing rigorous evidence —in the form of a lower bound
  against low-degree polynomials— of the computational hardness of this same certification
  problem when the number of observations is $o(d^2)$.
