title: Differential privacy and robust statistics in high dimensions
abstract: 'We introduce a universal framework for characterizing the statistical efficiency
  of a statistical estimation problem with differential privacy guarantees. Our framework,
  which we call High-dimensional Propose-Test-Release (HPTR), builds upon three crucial
  components: the exponential mechanism, robust statistics, and the  Propose-Test-Release
  mechanism. Connecting all these together is the concept of resilience, which is
  central to robust statistical estimation. Resilience guides the design of the algorithm,
  the sensitivity analysis, and the success probability analysis of the test step
  in Propose-Test-Release. The key insight is that if we design an exponential mechanism
  that accesses the data only via one-dimensional and robust statistics, then the
  resulting local sensitivity can be dramatically reduced. Using resilience, we can
  provide tight local sensitivity bounds. These tight bounds readily translate into
  near-optimal utility guarantees in several cases. We give a general recipe for applying
  HPTR to a given instance of a statistical estimation problem and demonstrate it
  on canonical problems of mean estimation, linear regression, covariance estimation,
  and principal component analysis. We introduce a general utility analysis technique
  that proves that HPTR achieves near-optimal sample complexity under several scenarios
  studied in the literature.'
