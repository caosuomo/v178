title: Analysis of Langevin Monte Carlo from Poincare to Log-Sobolev
abstract: Classically, the continuous-time Langevin diffusion converges exponentially
  fast to its stationary distribution $\pi$ under the sole assumption that $\pi$ satisfies
  a Poincaré inequality. Using this fact to provide guarantees for the discrete-time
  Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm, however, is considerably more challenging
  due to the need for working with chi-squared or Rényi divergences, and prior works
  have largely focused on strongly log-concave targets. In this work, we provide the
  first convergence guarantees for LMC assuming that $\pi$ satisfies either a Latał{}a–Oleszkiewicz
  or modified log-Sobolev inequality, which interpolates between the Poincaré and
  log-Sobolev settings. Unlike prior works, our results allow for weak smoothness
  and do not require convexity or dissipativity conditions.
