title: The Query Complexity of Local Search and Brouwer in Rounds
abstract: We consider the query complexity of finding a local minimum of a function
  defined on a graph, where at most $k$ rounds of interaction (aka adaptivity) with
  the oracle are allowed.  Adaptivity is a fundamental concept  studied due to the
  need to parallelize computation and understand the speedups attainable.   The query
  complexity of local search is tightly related to the complexity of computing stationary
  points of a function, thus bounds for local search can give insights into the performance
  of algorithms such as gradient descent. We focus on the $d$-dimensional grid $\{1,
  2, \ldots, n \}^d$, where the dimension $d \geq 2$ is a constant. Our main contribution
  is to give algorithms and lower bounds that characterize the trade-off between the
  number of rounds of adaptivity and the query complexity of local search, when the
  number of rounds is constant and polynomial in $n$, respectively. The local search
  analysis also enables us to characterize the query complexity of  computing a Brouwer
  fixed point in rounds.  Our proof technique for lower bounding the query complexity
  in rounds may be of independent interest as an alternative to the classical relational
  adversary method of Aaronson from the fully adaptive setting.
