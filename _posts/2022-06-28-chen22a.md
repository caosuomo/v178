title: Policy Optimization for Stochastic Shortest Path
abstract: Policy optimization is among the most popular and successful reinforcement
  learning algorithms, and there is increasing interest in understanding its theoretical
  guarantees. In this work, we initiate the study of policy optimization for the stochastic
  shortest path (SSP) problem, a goal-oriented reinforcement learning model that strictly
  generalizes the finite-horizon model and better captures many applications. We consider
  a wide range of settings, including stochastic and adversarial environments under
  full information or bandit feedback, and propose a policy optimization algorithm
  for each setting that makes use of novel correction terms and/or variants of dilated
  bonuses (Luo et al., 2021). For most settings, our algorithm is shown to achieve
  a near-optimal regret bound. One key technical contribution of this work is a new
  approximation scheme to tackle SSP problems that we call stacked discounted approximation
  and use in all our proposed algorithms. Unlike the finite-horizon approximation
  that is heavily used in recent SSP algorithms, our new approximation enables us
  to learn a near-stationary policy with only logarithmic changes during an episode
  and could lead to an exponential improvement in space complexity.
