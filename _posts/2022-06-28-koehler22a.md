title: 'Sampling Approximately Low-Rank Ising Models: MCMC meets Variational Methods'
abstract: We consider Ising models on the hypercube with a general interaction matrix
  $J$, and give a polynomial time sampling algorithm when all but $O(1)$ eigenvalues
  of $J$ lie in an interval of length one, a situation which occurs in many models
  of interest. This was previously known for the Glauber dynamics when \emph{all}
  eigenvalues fit in an interval of length one; however, a single outlier can force
  the Glauber dynamics to mix torpidly. Our general result implies the first polynomial
  time sampling algorithms for low-rank Ising models such as Hopfield networks with
  a fixed number of patterns and Bayesian clustering models with low-dimensional contexts,
  and greatly improves the polynomial time sampling regime for the antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic
  Ising model with inconsistent field on expander graphs. It also improves on previous
  approximation algorithm results based on the naive mean-field approximation in variational
  methods and statistical physics.  Our approach is based on a new fusion of ideas
  from the MCMC and variational inference worlds. As part of our algorithm, we define
  a new nonconvex variational problem which allows us to sample from an exponential
  reweighting of a distribution by a negative definite quadratic form, and show how
  to make this procedure provably efficient using stochastic gradient descent. On
  top of this, we construct a new simulated tempering chain (on an extended state
  space arising from the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform) which overcomes the obstacle
  posed by large positive eigenvalues, and combine it with the SGD-based sampler to
  solve the full problem.
