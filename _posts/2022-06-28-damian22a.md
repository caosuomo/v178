title: Neural Networks can Learn Representations with Gradient Descent
abstract: 'Significant theoretical work has established that in specific regimes,
  neural networks trained by gradient descent behave like kernel methods. However,
  in practice, it is known that neural networks strongly outperform their associated
  kernels. In this work, we explain this gap by demonstrating that there is a large
  class of functions which cannot be efficiently learned by kernel methods but can
  be easily learned with gradient descent on a two layer neural network outside the
  kernel regime by learning representations that are relevant to the target task.
  We also demonstrate that these representations allow for efficient transfer learning,
  which is impossible in the kernel regime. Specifically, we consider the problem
  of learning polynomials which depend on only a few relevant directions, i.e. of
  the form $f^\star(x) = g(Ux)$ where $U: \R^d \to \R^r$ with $d \gg r$. When the
  degree of $f^\star$ is $p$, it is known that $n \asymp d^p$ samples are necessary
  to learn $f^\star$ in the kernel regime. Our primary result is that gradient descent
  learns a representation of the data which depends only on the directions relevant
  to $f^\star$. This results in an improved sample complexity of $n\asymp d^2$ and
  enables transfer learning with sample complexity independent of $d$.'
