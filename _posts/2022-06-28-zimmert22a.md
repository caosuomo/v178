title: Pushing the Efficiency-Regret Pareto Frontier for Online Learning of Portfolios
  and Quantum States
abstract: We revisit the classical online portfolio selection problem. It is widely
  assumed that a trade-off between computational complexity and regret is unavoidable,
  with Cover’s Universal Portfolios algorithm, SOFT-BAYES and ADA-BARRONS currently
  constituting its state-of-the-art Pareto frontier. In this paper, we present the
  first efficient algorithm, BISONS, that obtains polylogarithmic regret with memory
  and per-step running time requirements that are polynomial in the dimension, displacing
  ADA-BARRONS from the Pareto frontier. Additionally, we resolve a COLT 2020 open
  problem by showing that a certain Follow-The-Regularized-Leader algorithm with log-barrier
  regularization suffers an exponentially larger dependence on the dimension than
  previously conjectured. Thus, we rule out this algorithm as a candidate for the
  Pareto frontier. We also extend our algorithm and analysis to a more general problem
  than online portfolio selection, viz. online learning of quantum states with log
  loss. This algorithm, called SCHRODINGER’S-BISONS, ibs the first efficient algorithm
  with polylogarithmic regret for this more general problem.
