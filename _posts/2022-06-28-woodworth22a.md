title: Non-Convex Optimization with Certificates and Fast Rates Through Kernel Sums
  of Squares
abstract: We consider potentially non-convex optimization problems, for which optimal
  rates of approximation depend on the dimension of the parameter space and the smoothness
  of the function to be optimized. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that achieves
  close to optimal a priori computational guarantees, while also providing a posteriori
  certificates of optimality. Our general formulation builds on infinite-dimensional
  sums-of-squares and Fourier analysis, and is instantiated on the minimization of
  periodic functions.
