title: Efficient Convex Optimization Requires Superlinear Memory
abstract: We show that any memory-constrained, first-order algorithm which minimizes 
  $d$-dimensional, $1$-Lipschitz convex functions over the unit ball to $1/\mathrm{poly}(d)$ 
  accuracy using at most $d^{1.25 - \delta}$ bits of memory must make at least $\Omega(d^{1 
  + (4/3)\delta})$ first-order queries (for any constant $\delta \in [0, 1/4]$). Consequently, 
  the performance of such memory-constrained algorithms are a polynomial factor worse than 
  the optimal $\tilde{O}(d)$ query bound for this problem obtained by cutting plane methods 
  that use $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ memory. This resolves one of the open problems in the COLT 2019 
  open problem publication of Woodworth and Srebro.
