title: Understanding Riemannian Acceleration via a Proximal Extragradient Framework
abstract: 'We contribute to advancing the understanding of Riemannian accelerated
  gradient methods. In particular, we revisit “\emph{Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient}”
  (A-HPE), a powerful framework for obtaining Euclidean accelerated methods \citep{monteiro2013accelerated}.
  Building on A-HPE, we then propose and analyze Riemannian A-HPE. The core of our
  analysis consists of two key components: (i) a set of new insights into Euclidean
  A-HPE itself; and (ii) a careful control of metric distortion caused by Riemannian
  geometry. We illustrate our framework by obtaining a few existing and new Riemannian
  accelerated gradient methods as special cases, while characterizing their acceleration
  as corollaries of our main results.'
