title: On the Role of Channel Capacity in Learning Gaussian Mixture Models
abstract: 'This paper studies the sample complexity of learning the $k$ unknown centers
  of a balanced Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with spherical covariance
  matrix $\sigma^2\bm{I}$. In particular, we are interested in the following question:
  what is the maximal noise level $\sigma^2$, for which the sample complexity is essentially
  the same as when estimating the centers from labeled measurements? To that end,
  we restrict attention to a Bayesian formulation of the problem, where the centers
  are uniformly distributed on the sphere $\sqrt{d}\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$. Our main results
  characterize the \emph{exact noise threshold} $\sigma^2$ below which the GMM learning
  problem, in the large system limit $d,k\to\infty$, is as easy as learning from labeled
  observations, and above which it is substantially harder. The threshold occurs at
  $\frac{\log k}{d} = \frac12\log\left( 1+\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \right)$, which is the
  capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Thinking of the set
  of $k$ centers as a code, this noise threshold can be interpreted as the largest
  noise level for which the error probability of the code over the AWGN channel is
  small. Previous works on the GMM learning problem have identified the \emph{minimum
  distance} between the centers as a key parameter in determining the statistical
  difficulty of learning the corresponding GMM.  While our results are only proved
  for GMMs whose centers are uniformly distributed over the sphere, they hint that
  perhaps it is the decoding error probability associated with the center constellation
  as a channel code that determines the statistical difficulty of learning the corresponding
  GMM, rather than just the minimum distance.'
