title: The Price of Tolerance in Distribution Testing
abstract: We revisit the problem of tolerant distribution testing. That is, given
  samples from an unknown distribution $p$ over $\{1, â€¦, n\}$, is it $\varepsilon_1$-close
  to or $\varepsilon_2$-far from a reference distribution $q$ (in total variation
  distance)? Despite significant interest over the past decade, this problem is well
  understood only in the extreme cases. In the noiseless setting (i.e., $\varepsilon_1
  = 0$) the sample complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, strongly sublinear in the domain
  size. At the other end of the spectrum, when $\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2/2$,
  the sample complexity jumps to the barely sublinear $\Theta(n/\log n)$. However,
  very little is known about the intermediate regime. We fully characterize the price
  of tolerance in distribution testing as a function of $n$, $\varepsilon_1$, $\varepsilon_2$,
  up to a single $\log n$ factor. Specifically, we show the sample complexity to be  \[\tilde
  \Theta\mleft(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\ve_2^{2}} + \frac{n}{\log n} \cdot \max \mleft\{\frac{\ve_1}{\ve_2^2},\mleft(\frac{\ve_1}{\ve_2^2}\mright)^{\!\!2}\mright\}\mright),\]{providing}
  a smooth tradeoff between the two previously known cases. We also provide a similar
  characterization for the problem of tolerant equivalence testing, where both $p$
  and $q$ are unknown. Surprisingly, in both cases, the main quantity dictating the
  sample complexity is the ratio $\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2^2$, and not the more
  intuitive $\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2$. Of particular technical interest is our
  lower bound framework, which involves novel approximation-theoretic tools required
  to handle the asymmetry between $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$, a challenge
  absent from previous works.
