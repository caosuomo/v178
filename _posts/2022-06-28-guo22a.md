title: Online Learning to Transport via the Minimal Selection Principle
abstract: Motivated by robust dynamic resource allocation in operations research,
  we study the Online Learning to Transport (OLT) problem where the decision variable
  is a probability measure, an infinite-dimensional object. We draw connections between
  online learning, optimal transport, and partial differential equations through an
  insight called the minimal selection principle, originally studied in the Wasserstein
  gradient flow setting by Ambrosio et al. (2005). This allows us to extend the standard
  online learning framework to the infinite-dimensional setting seamlessly. Based
  on our framework, we derive a novel method called the minimal selection or exploration
  (MSoE) algorithm to solve OLT problems using mean-field approximation and discretization
  techniques. In the displacement convex setting, the main theoretical message underpinning
  our approach is that minimizing transport cost over time (via the minimal selection
  principle) ensures optimal cumulative regret upper bounds. On the algorithmic side,
  our MSoE algorithm applies beyond the displacement convex setting, making the mathematical
  theory of optimal transport practically relevant to non-convex settings common in
  dynamic resource allocation.
