title: 'Open Problem: Optimal Best Arm Identification with Fixed-Budget'
abstract: 'Best arm identification or pure exploration problems have received much attention in the COLT community since Bubeck et al. (2009) and Audibert et al. (2010). For any bandit instance with a unique best arm, its asymptotic complexity in the so-called fixed-confidence setting has been completely characterized in Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) and Chernoff (1959), while little is known about the asymptotic complexity in its “dual” setting called fixed-budget setting. This note discusses the open problems and conjectures about the instance-dependent asymptotic complexity in the fixed-budget setting.'
