title: Towards Optimal Algorithms for Multi-Player Bandits without Collision Sensing
  Information
abstract: 'We propose a novel algorithm for multi-player multi-armed bandits without
  collision sensing information. Our algorithm circumvents two problems shared by
  all state-of-the-art algorithms: it does not need as an input a lower bound on the
  minimal expected reward of an arm, and its performance does not scale inversely
  proportionally to the minimal expected reward. We prove a theoretical regret upper
  bound to justify these claims. We complement our theoretical results with numerical
  experiments, showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art in
  practice.'
