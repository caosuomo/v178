title: A bounded-noise mechanism for differential privacy
abstract: We present an asymptotically optimal $(\epsilon,\delta)$ differentially
  private mechanism for answering multiple, adaptively asked, $\Delta$-sensitive queries,
  settling the conjecture of Steinke and Ullman [2020].  Our algorithm has a significant
  advantage that it adds independent bounded noise to each query, thus providing an
  absolute error bound. Additionally, we apply our algorithm in adaptive data analysis,
  obtaining an improved guarantee for answering multiple queries regarding some underlying
  distribution using a finite sample. Numerical computations show that the bounded-noise
  mechanism outperforms the Gaussian mechanism in many standard settings.
