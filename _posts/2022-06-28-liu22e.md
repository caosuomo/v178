title: The Pareto Frontier of Instance-Dependent Guarantees in Multi-Player Multi-Armed
  Bandits with no Communication
abstract: We study the stochastic multi-player multi-armed bandit problem.  In this
  problem, there are $m$ players and $K > m$ arms and the players cooperate to maximize
  their total reward. However the players cannot communicate and are penalized (e.g.
  receive no reward) if they pull the same arm at the same time.  We ask whether it
  is possible to obtain optimal instance-dependent regret $\wt{O}(1/\Delta)$ where
  $\Delta$ is the gap between the $m$-th and $m+1$-st best arms.  Such guarantees
  were recently achieved by \cite{pacchiano2021instance, huang2021towards} in a model
  in which the players are able to implicitly communicate through intentional collisions.
  We show that with no communication at all, such guarantees are, surprisingly, not  achievable.  In
  fact, obtaining the optimal $\wt{O}(1/\Delta)$ regret for some regimes of $\Delta$
  necessarily implies strictly sub-optimal regret in other regimes.  Our main result
  is a complete characterization of the Pareto optimal instance-dependent trade-offs
  that are possible with no communication. Our algorithm generalizes that of \cite{bubeck2021cooperative}
  and enjoys the same strong no-collision property, while our lower bound is completely
  new.
