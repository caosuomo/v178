title: The query complexity of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions in
  one dimension
abstract: We establish the first tight lower bound of $\Omega(\log\log\kappa)$ on
  the query complexity of sampling from the class of strongly log-concave and log-smooth
  distributions with condition number $\kappa$ in one dimension. Whereas existing
  guarantees for MCMC-based algorithms scale polynomially in $\kappa$, we introduce
  a novel algorithm based on rejection sampling that closes this doubly exponential
  gap.
