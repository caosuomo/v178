title: Robustly-reliable learners under poisoning attacks
abstract: 'Data poisoning attacks, in which an adversary corrupts a training set with
  the goal of inducing specific desired mistakes, have raised substantial concern:
  even just the possibility of such an attack can make a user no longer trust the
  results of a learning system. In this work, we analyze when strong robustness guarantees
  can be achieved even in the face of such attacks. We define and show how to provide
  robustly-reliable predictions, in which the predicted label is guaranteed to be
  correct so long as the adversary has not exceeded a given corruption budget, even
  in the presence of instance targeted attacks, where the adversary aims to cause
  a failure on specific test examples.  Our guarantees are substantially stronger
  than those in prior approaches, which were only able to provide certificates that
  the prediction of the learning algorithm does not change,  as opposed to certifying
  that the prediction is correct, as we do here. Remarkably, we provide a complete
  characterization of learnability in this setting, in particular, nearly-tight matching
  upper and lower bounds on the region that can be certified, as well as efficient
  algorithms for computing this region given an ERM oracle. Moreover, for the case
  of linear separators over logconcave distributions, we provide efficient truly polynomial
  time algorithms (i.e., non-oracle algorithms) for such robustly-reliable predictions.
  We also extend these results to the active setting where the algorithm adaptively
  asks for labels of specific informative examples, and the difficulty is that the
  adversary might even be adaptive to this interaction, as well as to the  agnostic
  learning setting where there is no perfect classifier even over the uncorrupted
  data.'
