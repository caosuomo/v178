title: Chained generalisation bounds
abstract: This work discusses how to derive upper bounds for the expected generalisation
  error of supervised learning algorithms by means of the chaining technique. By developing
  a general theoretical framework, we establish a duality between generalisation bounds
  based on the regularity of the loss function, and their chained counterparts, which
  can be obtained by lifting the regularity assumption from the loss onto its gradient.
  This allows us to re-derive the chaining mutual information bound from the literature,
  and to obtain novel chained information-theoretic generalisation bounds, based on
  the Wasserstein distance and other probability metrics. We show on some toy examples
  that the chained generalisation bound can be significantly tighter than its standard
  counterpart, particularly when the distribution of the hypotheses selected by the
  algorithm is very concentrated.
