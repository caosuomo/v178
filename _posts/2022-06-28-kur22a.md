title: An Efficient Minimax Optimal Estimator For Multivariate Convex Regression
abstract: We study the computational aspects of the task of multivariate convex regression
  in dimension $d \geq 5$. We present the first computationally efficient minimax
  optimal (up to logarithmic factors) estimators for the tasks of $L$-Lipschitz and
  $\Gamma$-bounded convex regression under polytopal support. This work is the first
  to show the existence of efficient minimax optimal estimators for non-Donsker classes
  whose corresponding Least Squares Estimators are provably minimax suboptimal. The
  proof of the correctness of these estimators uses a variety of tools from different
  disciplines, among them empirical process theory, stochastic geometry, and potential
  theory.
