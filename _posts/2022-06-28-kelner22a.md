title: 'Big-Step-Little-Step: Efficient Gradient Methods for Objectives with Multiple
  Scales'
abstract: 'We provide new gradient-based methods for efficiently solving a broad class
  of ill-conditioned optimization problems. We consider the problem of minimizing
  a function $f : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which is implicitly decomposable
  as the sum of $m$ unknown non-interacting smooth, strongly convex functions and
  provide a method which solves this problem with a number of gradient evaluations
  that scales (up to logarithmic factors) as the product of the square-root of the
  condition numbers of the components. This complexity bound (which we prove is nearly
  optimal) can improve almost exponentially on that of accelerated gradient methods,
  which grow as the square root of the condition number of $f$. Additionally, we provide
  efficient methods for solving stochastic, quadratic variants of this multiscale
  optimization problem. Rather than learn the decomposition of $f$ (which would be
  prohibitively expensive), our methods apply a clean recursive “Big-Step-Little-Step”
  interleaving of standard methods. The resulting algorithms use  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d
  m)$ space, are numerically stable, and open the door to a more fine-grained understanding
  of the complexity of convex optimization beyond condition number.'
