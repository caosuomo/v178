title: Streaming Algorithms for Ellipsoidal Approximation of Convex Polytopes
abstract: We give efficient deterministic one-pass streaming algorithms for finding
  an ellipsoidal approximation of a symmetric convex polytope. The algorithms are
  near-optimal in that their approximation factors differ from that of the optimal
  offline solution only by a factor sub-logarithmic in the aspect ratio of the polytope.
