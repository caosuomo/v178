title: A Private and Computationally-Efficient Estimator for Unbounded Gaussians
abstract: We give the first polynomial-time, polynomial-sample, differentially private
  estimator for the mean and covariance of an arbitrary Gaussian distribution $N(\mu,\Sigma)$
  in $\R^d$.  All previous estimators are either nonconstructive, with unbounded running
  time, or require the user to specify a priori bounds on the parameters $\mu$ and
  $\Sigma$.  The primary new technical tool in our algorithm is a new differentially
  private preconditioner that takes samples from an arbitrary Gaussian $N(0,\Sigma)$
  and returns a matrix $A$ such that $A \Sigma A^T$ has constant condition number
