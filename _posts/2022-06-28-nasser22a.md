title: Optimal SQ Lower Bounds for Learning Halfspaces with Massart Noise
abstract: We give tight statistical query (SQ) lower bounds for learnining halfspaces
  in the presence of Massart noise. In particular, suppose that all labels are corrupted
  with probability at most $\eta$. We show that for arbitrary $\eta \in [0,1/2]$ every
  SQ algorithm achieving misclassification error better than $\eta$ requires queries
  of superpolynomial accuracy or at least a superpolynomial number of queries. Further,
  this continues to hold even if the information-theoretically optimal error $\OPT$
  is as small as $\exp\Paren{-\log^c(d)}$, where $d$ is the dimension and $0 < c <
  1$ is an arbitrary absolute constant, and an overwhelming fraction of examples are
  noiseless. Our lower bound matches known polynomial time algorithms, which are also
  implementable in the SQ framework. Previously, such lower bounds only ruled out
  algorithms achieving error $\OPT + \e$ or error better than $\Omega(\eta)$ or, if
  $\eta$ is close to $1/2$, error $\eta - o_\eta(1)$, where the term $o_\eta(1)$ is
  constant in $d$ but going to 0 for $\eta$ approaching $1/2$. As a consequence, we
  also show that achieving misclassification error better than $1/2$ in the $(A,\alpha)$-Tsybakov
  model is SQ-hard for $A$ constant and $\alpha$ bounded away from 1.
