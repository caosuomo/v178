title: Statistical and Computational Phase Transitions in Group Testing
abstract: 'We study the group testing problem where the goal is to identify a set
  of k infected individuals carrying a rare disease within a population of size n,
  based on the outcomes of pooled tests which return positive whenever there is at
  least one infected individual in the tested group. We consider two different simple
  random procedures for assigning individuals to tests: the constant-column design
  and Bernoulli design. Our first set of results concerns the fundamental statistical
  limits. For the constant-column design, we give a new information-theoretic lower
  bound which implies that the proportion of correctly identifiable infected individuals
  undergoes a sharp “all-or-nothing” phase transition when the number of tests crosses
  a particular threshold. For the Bernoulli design, we determine the precise number
  of tests required to solve the associated detection problem (where the goal is to
  distinguish between a group testing instance and pure noise), improving both the
  upper and lower bounds of Truong, Aldridge, and Scarlett (2020). For both group
  testing models, we also study the power of computationally efficient (polynomial-time)
  inference procedures. We determine the precise number of tests required for the
  class of low-degree polynomial algorithms to solve the detection problem. This provides
  evidence for an inherent computational-statistical gap in both the detection and
  recovery problems at small sparsity levels. Notably, our evidence is contrary to
  that of Iliopoulos and Zadik (2021), who predicted the absence of a computational-statistical
  gap in the Bernoulli design.'
