title: Damped Online Newton Step for Portfolio Selection
abstract: We revisit the classic online portfolio selection problem, where at each
  round a learner selects a distribution over a set of portfolios to allocate its
  wealth. It is known that for this problem a logarithmic regret with respect to Coverâ€™s
  loss is achievable using the Universal Portfolio Selection algorithm, for example.
  However, all existing algorithms that achieve a logarithmic regret for this problem
  have per-round time and space complexities that scale polynomially with the total
  number of rounds, making them impractical. In this paper, we build on the recent
  work by Luo et al. 2018 and present the first practical online portfolio selection
  algorithm with a logarithmic regret and whose per-round time and space complexities
  depend only logarithmically on the horizon. Behind our approach are two key technical
  novelties. We first show that the Damped Online Newton steps can approximate mirror
  descent iterates well, even when dealing with time-varying regularizers. Second,
  we present a new meta-algorithm that achieves an adaptive, logarithmic regret (i.e.
  a logarithmic regret on any sub-interval) for mixable losses.
