title: 'Universal Online Learning with Bounded Loss: Reduction to Binary Classification'
abstract: We study universal consistency of non-i.i.d. processes in the context of
  online learning. A stochastic process is said to admit universal consistency if
  there exists a learner that achieves vanishing average loss for any measurable response
  function on this process. When the loss function is unbounded, [1] showed that the
  only processes admitting strong universal consistency are those taking a finite
  number of values almost surely. However, when the loss function is bounded, the
  class of processes admitting strong universal consistency is much richer and its
  characterization could be dependent on the response setting [2]. In this paper,
  we show that this class of processes is independent from the response setting thereby
  closing an open question of [3] (Open Problem 3). Specifically, we show that the
  class of processes that admit universal online learning is the same for binary classification
  as for multiclass classification with countable number of classes. Consequently,
  any output setting with bounded loss can be reduced to binary classification. Our
  reduction is constructive and practical. Indeed, we show that the nearest neighbor
  algorithm is transported by our construction. For binary classification on a process
  admitting strong universal learning, we prove that nearest neighbor successfully
  learns at least all finite unions of intervals.
