title: 'Corralling a Larger Band of Bandits: A Case Study on Switching Regret for
  Linear Bandits'
abstract: We consider the problem of combining and learning over a set of adversarial
  bandit algorithms with the goal of adaptively tracking the best one on the fly.
  The Corral algorithm of Agarwal et al. (2017) and its variants (Foster et al., 2020a)
  achieve this goal with a regret overhead of order $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{MT})$ where $M$
  is the number of base algorithms and $T$ is the time horizon. The polynomial dependence
  on $M$, however, prevents one from applying these algorithms to many applications
  where $M$ is $\mbox{poly}(T)$ or even larger. Motivated by this issue, we propose
  a new recipe to corral a larger band of bandit algorithms whose regret overhead
  has only \emph{logarithmic} dependence on $M$ as long as some conditions are satisfied.
  As the main example, we apply our recipe to the problem of adversarial linear bandits
  over a $d$-dimensional $\ell_p$ unit-ball for $p \in (1,2]$. By corralling a large
  set of $T$ base algorithms, each starting at a different time step, our final algorithm
  achieves the first optimal switching regret $\tilde{Ã˜}(\sqrt{d S T})$ when competing
  against a sequence of comparators with $S$ switches (for some known $S$). We further
  extend our results to linear bandits over a smooth and strongly convex domain as
  well as unconstrained linear bandits.
