title: Corruption-Robust Contextual Search through Density Updates
abstract: We study the problem of contextual search in the adversarial noise model.  Let
  $d$ be the dimension of the problem, $T$ be the time horizon and $C$ be the total
  amount of noise in the system. For the $\epsilon$-ball loss, we give a tight regret
  bound of $O(C + d \log(1/\epsilon))$ improving over the $O(d^3 \log(1/\epsilon))
  \log^2(T) + C \log(T) \log(1/\epsilon))$ bound of Krishnamurthy et al (STOCâ€™21).
  For the symmetric loss, we give an efficient algorithm with regret $O(C+d \log T)$.
  In terms of techniques, our algorithms are a departure from previous contextual
  search models in the sense that they keep track of density functions over the candidate
  vectors instead of a knowledge set consisting of the candidate vectors consistent
  with the feedback obtained.
