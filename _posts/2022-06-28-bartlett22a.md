title: Generalization Bounds for Data-Driven Numerical Linear Algebra
abstract: Data-driven algorithms can adapt their internal structure or parameters
  to inputs from unknown application-specific distributions, by learning from a training
  sample of inputs. Several recent works have applied this approach to problems in
  numerical linear algebra, obtaining significant empirical gains in performance.
  However, no theoretical explanation for their success was known.  In this work we
  prove generalization bounds for those algorithms, within the PAC-learning framework
  for data-driven algorithm selection proposed by Gupta and Roughgarden (SICOMP 2017).
  Our main results are closely matching upper and lower bounds on the fat shattering
  dimension of the learning-based low rank approximation algorithm of Indyk et al.Â (NeurIPS
  2019). Our techniques are general, and provide generalization bounds for many other
  recently proposed data-driven algorithms in numerical linear algebra, covering both
  sketching-based and multigrid-based methods. This considerably broadens the class
  of data-driven algorithms for which a PAC-learning analysis is available.
