title: Robust Sparse Mean Estimation via Sum of Squares
abstract: We study the problem of high-dimensional sparse mean estimation in the presence
  of an $\epsilon$-fraction of adversarial outliers. Prior work obtained sample and
  computationally efficient algorithms for this task for identity-covariance subgaussian
  distributions. In this work, we develop the first efficient algorithms for robust
  sparse mean estimation without a priori knowledge of the covariance. For distributions
  on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with ‘certifiably bounded’ $t$-th moments and sufficiently light
  tails, our algorithm achieves error of $O(\epsilon^{1-1/t})$ with sample complexity
  $m = (k\log(d))^{O(t)}/\epsilon^{2-2/t}$. For the special case of the Gaussian distribution,
  our algorithm achieves near-optimal error of $\tilde O(\epsilon)$ with sample complexity
  $m = O(k^4 \mathrm{polylog}(d))/\epsilon^2$. Our algorithms follow the Sum-of-Squares
  based proofs to algorithms approach. We complement our upper bounds with Statistical
  Query and low-degree polynomial testing lower bounds, providing evidence that the
  sample-time-error tradeoffs achieved by our algorithms are qualitatively best possible.
